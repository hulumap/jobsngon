        histories of 200 young boys. They were asked to write an evaluation of each boy’s
        future. In every case the students wrote, “He hasn’t got a chance.”</br></br>
        Twenty-five years later, another sociology professor came across the ealier
        study. He had his students follow up on the project to see what had happened to these boys. With the exception of 20
        boys who had moved away or not contacted, the students learned that 176 of the remaining 180 had achieved more
        than ordinary success as lawyers, doctors and bussinessmen.</br></br>
        The professor was astounded so he decided to pursue the matter further. Fortunately, all the men were in the
        area, and he was able to speak to each one. “How do you account for your success?” In each case the reply came with
        feeling: “There was a teacher.”</br></br>
        The teacher was still alive, so he sought her out and asked the old but still alert lady what magic formula she had
        used to pull these boys out of the slums and into successful achievement.
        The teacher’s eyes sparkled and her lips broke into a gentle smile. “It’s really very simple,” she said. “I believed
        those boys.”

        Một ngày kia, ông tới thăm một thương gia ở Hamburg, người này có cô con gái
        rất dễ thương tên là Frumtje. Ngay khi gặp Frumtje, Moses đã yêu cô say đắm nhưng
        tuyệt vọng bởi cô tỏ ra sợ sệt vẻ ngoài xấu xí của ông. </br></br>
        Đến lúc phải ra về, Moses thu hết can đảm đi lên cầu thang vào phòng cô gái, hy vọng có một cơ hội cuối cùng được
        nói chuyện với cô. Đối với ông, cô là hiện thân cho vẻ đẹp thiên thần, nhưng cô đã làm ông thật buồn khi luôn tránh nhìn
        ông. Sau những cố gắng để có được một vài câu xã giao, Moses bối rối hỏi cô, “Cô có tin hôn nhân là việc đã được định
        đoạt bởi kiếp trước trên thiên đường không?”. </br></br>
        “Tôi tin”, cô gái trả lời trong khi mắt vẫn nhìn xuống sàn nhà. “Và ông cũng tin chứ?”. </br></br>

        ấy biết về cô gái mà cậu sẽ cưới làm vợ. Khi tôi sinh ra, cô dâu tương lai của tôi cũng đã được chỉ định. Chúa còn nói thêm

        hãy ban cho con cái bướu đó để người vợ của con được xinh đẹp’”. </br></br>

        When it came time for him to leave, Moses gathered his courage and climbed the stairs to her room to take one
        last opportunity to speak with her. She was a vision of heavenly beauty, but caused him deep sadness by her refusal to
        look at him. After several attempts at conversation, Moses shyly asked,</br></br> “Do you believe marriages are made in
        heaven?” </br></br>
        "“Yes,” she answered, still looking at floor. “And do you?”</br></br>

        Một ngày kia, cô con gái không còn bé bỏng ấy quyết định rời khỏi ngôi nhà thân yêu của mình để khám phá thế
        giới xung quanh. Khi cô gái thật sự hiểu về bản thân mình thì cũng là lúc cô hiểu về cha mình hơn. Một trong những điểm
        mạnh của ông là ông luôn bày tỏ tình thương yêu với gia đình của mình. Bất kể cô đang ở đâu, cha vẫn gọi cô và nói rằng:
        <br/><br/>“Bố yêu con, con gái bé bỏng của bố”.<br/><br/>
        Một ngày nọ, cô gái nhận được một cú điện thoại không mong đợi: cha cô đã bị liệt sau một con đột quỵ. Ông không
        thể nói, không thể cười, không thể đi lại… và không thể nói được với cô rằng ông rất yêu cô.<br/><br/>
        Cô trở về bên cha. Khi bước vào phòng, cô thấy ông nằm đó, trông thật bé nhỏ và ốm yếu. Ông gắng gượng trò
        chuyện cùng cô nhưng không thể. Điều duy nhất mà cô có thể làm là ngồi bên cạnh ông, vòng tay ôm lấy đôi vai bất động
        của cha mình. Tựa đầu lên ngực cha, cô suy ngẫm nhiều điều. Cô nhớ lại rằng mình luôn cảm thấy được cha che chở, nâng
        niu từ tấm bé. Cô thấy lòng quặn thắt trước nỗi đau sắp mất đi người cha yêu quý. Không còn nữa rồi những lời yêu thương
        vỗ về của cha.<br/><br/>
        Và bỗng nhiên, cô nghe tiếng nhịp đập trái tim người cha. Trái tim ông vẫn đập đều đều, mạnh mẽ, như muốn vượt
        lên tất cả những phần cơ thể đau yếu còn lại. Và trong giây phút được bình yên trên ngực cha như thế, điều kỳ diệu đã xảy
        ra: Cô đã nghe được những lời yêu thương mà cô muốn nghe!<br/><br/>
        Trái tim của người cha phát ra những lời mà miệng ông không còn nói được nữa: “Bố yêu con, con gái bé bỏng của
        bố…Bố yêu con…” và cô đã được vỗ về, an ủi bởi những lời nói yêu thương vô hình ấy của cha.`,

        created a little lovely girl.<br/> <br/>
        When the little girl was growing up, the great man would hug her and tell her,“I

        Then the man would laugh and say:<br/><br/> “But to me, you’ll always be my little girl.”<br/><br/>
        The little girl who was not little anymore decided to leave her home and went into the world. As she learned
        more about herself, she learned more about the man. One of his strengths was his ability to express his love to his
        family. It didn’t matter where she went in the world, the man would call her and say,<br/><br/> “I love you, little girl.”<br/><br/>
        The day came when the little girl who was not little anymore received an unexpected phone call. The great man

        And so she went to the side of the great man. When she walked into the room and saw him, he looked small and not
        strong at all. He looked at her and tried to speak, but he could not. The little girl did the only thing she could do. She sat
        next to the great man, and drew her arms around the useless shoulders of her father. Her head on his chest, she
        thought of many things. She remembered she had always felt protected and cherished by the great man. She felt grief
        for the loss she was to endure, the words of love that had comforted her.<br/><br/>
        And then she heard from within the man, the beat of his heart. The heart beat on, steadily unconcerned about the
        damage to the rest of the body. And while she rested there, the magic happened. She heard what she needed to hear.<br/> <br/>
        His heart beat out the words that his mouth could no longer say…I love you, little girl…I love you, little girl…and
        she was comforted.

        một tuần, anh chị hãy đến gặp người mà mình quan tâm và nói với họ rằng anh chị yêu
        mến họ. Đó phải là người mà trước đây, hoặc đã lâu anh chị không nói những lời như
        vậy ”.<br/><br/>
        Đề bài xem ra đơn giản. Thế nhưng, hầu hết cánh đàn ông trong lớp đều đã trên 30 tuổi và cảm thấy vô cùng khó
        khăn khi thực hiện đề bài này vì họ hiếm khi thể hiện tình cảm của mình với một ai đó.
        Đầu giờ học tuần sau, vị giáo sư hỏi có ai muốn kể lại cho cả lớp nghe câu chuy ện của mình hay không. Dường như
        ông chờ đợi một phụ nữ xung phong trả lời. Thế nhưng, một cánh tay nam giới đã giơ lên. Anh ta trông có vẻ xúc động
        lắm:<br/><br/>
        “Cách đây 5 năm, giữa tôi và bố có một bất đồng sâu sắc, và từ đó đến nay vẫn chưa giải quyết được. Tôi tránh gặp
        mặt ông ngoại trừ những trường hợp chẳng đặng đừng khi phải họp mặt gia đình. Nhưng ngay cả những lúc ấy, chúng tôi
        cũng hầu như không nói với nhau một lời nào. Vì vậy, tôi đã tự thuyết phục bản thân đến để xin lỗi và nói với bố tôi rằng
        tôi yêu ông ấy.
        <br/><br/>
        Quyết định ấy dường như đã làm giảm đi phần nào áp lực nặng nề trong lòng tôi. Đêm hôm đó, tôi hầu như chẳng
        chợp mắt được. Ngày hôm sau, tôi đến nhà bố mẹ và bấm chuông, lòng thầm mong bố sẽ mở cửa cho tôi.
        Tôi lo sợ rằng nếu mẹ mở cửa thì dự định của tôi sẽ không thành, tôi sẽ bày tỏ với mẹ thay vì với bố. Nhưng may quá,
        bố tôi đã ra mở cửa. Tôi bước vào và nói: ‘Con không làm mất thời gian của bố đâu, con đến chỉ để nói với bố rằng bố hãy
        tha lỗi cho con và con yêu bố’.
        <br/><br/>
        Có một sự chuy ển biến trên khuôn mặt bố tôi. Gương mặt ông dãn ra, những nếp nhăn dường như biến mất và ông bắt
        đầu khóc. Ông bước đến, ôm chầm lấy tôi và nói:<br/><br/> ‘Bố cũng yêu con, con trai ạ. Nhưng bố chưa biết làm thế nào để có thể
        nói với con điều đó’.<br/><br/>
        Đó là thời khắc quý báu nhất trong đời tôi. Hai ngày sau, bố tôi đột ngột bị một cơn đau tim và vẫn còn nằm trong
        bệnh viện cho đến bây giờ. Nếu như tôi trì hoãn bộc lộ với bố, có lẽ tôi không bao giờ còn có cơ hội nào nữa.”`,

        The assignment looked easy. However, almost the men of the course, who were over
        30 years old, found it difficult to carry out because rarely had the expressed their feelings to someone else.<br/> <br/>
        At the beginning of the next class, the professor asked his students to retell their stories. It seemed that he waited
        for a woman, but an arm of a man raised. He looked so touched. He began his story:<br/><br/>
        “Five years ago, my father and I had a vicious disagreement and never really resolved it. We avoided seeing each
        other unless we absolutely had to at family gatherings. Even those times, we hardly spoke. So by the time I got home, I
        had convinced myself I was going to tell my father I loved him.<br/><br/>
        Just making that decision seemed to lift a heavy load off my chest. During that night, I hardly sleep. Next day, I
        was at my parents’ house ringing the doorbell, praying that Dad would answer the door.<br/> <br/> I was afraid if Mom answered,
        I would chicken out and tell her instead. But as luck would have it, Dad did answer the door.<br/><br/>
        ‘I didn’t waste any time’ – I took one step in the door and said, ‘Dad, I just came over to tell you that please forgive
        me and I love you.’<br/><br/>
        It was as if a transformation came over my dad. Before my eyes his face softened, the wrinkles seemed to
        disappear and he began to cry. He reached out and hugged me and said, ‘I love you too, son, but I’ve never been able
        to say it.’<br/><br/>
        But that’s not even my point. Two days after that visit, my dad had a sudden heart attack and now is still in the
        hospital. If I am still hesitating about talking to my father, I may not have no chance to do so.”`,

        seemed endless. His body became numb and stiff from the frigid north wind.<br/> <br/>
        He heard the faint, steady rhy thm of approaching hooves galloping along the frozen
        path. Anxiously, he watched as several horsemen rounded the bend. He let the first one pass by without an effort to get
        his attention. Then another passed by, and another. Finally, the last rider neared the spot where the old man sat like a
        snow statue. As this one drew near, the old man caught the rider’s eye and said, “Sir, would you mind giving an old
        man a ride to the other side? There doesn’t appear to be a passageway by foot.”<br/> <br/>
        Reigning his horse, the rider replied, “Sure thing. Hop aboard.” Seeing the old man was unable to lift his halffrozen body from the ground, the horseman dismounted and helped the old man onto the horse. The horseman took
        the old man not just across the river, but to his destination, which was just a few miles away.<br/> <br/>
        As they neared the tiny but cozy cottage, the horseman’s curiosity caused him to inquire, “Sir, I notice that you
        let several other riders pass by without making an effort to secure a ride. I’m curious why, on such a bitter winter
        night, you would wait and ask the last rider. What if I had refused and left you there?”<br/> <br/>
        The old man lowered himself slowly down from the horse, looked the rider straight in the eyes, and replied, “I’ve
        been around these here parts for some time. I reckon I know people pretty good”. The old-timer continued, “I looked
        into the eyes of the other riders and immediately saw there was no concern for my situation. It would have been
        useless even to ask them for a ride. But when I looked into your eyes, kindness and compassion were evident. I knew,
        then and there, that your gentle spirit would welcome the opportunity to give me assistance in my time of need.”<br/> <br/>
        Those heartwarming comments touched the horseman deeply. “I’m most grateful for what you have said,” he told
        the old man. “May I never get too busy in my own affairs that I fail to respond to the needs of others with kindness and
        compassion.”<br/> <br/>

        Tommy, an only child, had always been happy, cooperative, and an excellent
        student. How could I convince his father and mother that his recent failing grades represented a brokenhearted child’s
        reaction to his adored parents’ separation and pending divorce?<br/> <br/>

        strange emotion as she saw how fragile it appeared. This was a very special gift the gods
        were entrusting to her. A gift that would one day belong to the world. Until then, they
        instructed her, she was to be its guardian and protector. The woman said she understood
        and reverently took it home, determined to live up to the faith the gods had placed in her.<br/> <br/>

        watching with fear in her heart when it was exposed to the environment outside of the sheltered cocoon she had
        formed around it. But the woman began to realize that she could not shelter it forever. It needed to learn to survive the
        harsh elements in order to grow strong. So with gentle care she gave it more space to grow… enough to allow it to grow
        wild and untamed.<br/> <br/>
        One day, she became aware of how much the gift had changed. It not longer had a look of vulnerability about it.
        Now it seemed to glow with strength and steadiness, almost as if it were developing a power within. Month after month
        she watched as it became stronger and more powerful. She knew deep within her heart that her time with the gift was
        nearing an end.<br/> <br/>
        The inevitable day arrived when the gods came to take the gift and present it to the world. The woman felt a deep
        sadness, for she would miss its constant presence in her life. With heartfelt gratitude she thanked the gods for allowing
        her the privilege of watching over the precious gift for so many years. Straightening her shoulders, she stood proud,
        knowing that it was, indeed, a very special gift. One that would add to the beauty and essence of the world around it.

        love. She was a woman who embraced the concept that she could give her child something no one else ever could… a
        better life than she had. Melanie’s heart beats close to mine as I hold her and tell her how great she performed. She
        wiggles in my arms and looks up at me. “Why are you crying, Mommie?”<br/> <br/>
        I answer her, “Because I am so happy for you and you did so good, all by yourself!” I can feel myself reach out
        with tendrils of love and hold her with more than just my arms. I hold her with love for not only myself, but for the
        beautiful and courageous woman who chose to give birth to my daughter, and then chose again to give her to me. I
        carry the love from both of us… the birth mother with the courage to share, and the woman whose empty arms were

        After reading, his mother looked at him standing there, expectantly. She picked up the pen, turned the paper over
and wrote:<br/> <br/>
Nine months I carried you while you were inside me: No charge.<br/> <br/>
The times I’ve sat with you, doctored and prayed for you: No charge.<br/> <br/>
For all the tears that you’ve caused through the years: No charge.<br/> <br/>
For all the nights that I couldn’t sleep because of the worried I knew were ahead: No charge.<br/> <br/>
For all the toys, food, clothes, that I gave to you through the years: there’s No charge, son.<br/> <br/>
And when you add it all up, the full cost of real love is, No charge.<br/> <br/>
When the boy finished reading what his mother had written, there were great big old tears in his eyes. He looked
straight at his mother and said, “Mom, I sure do love you.”<br/> <br/>
And then he took the pen and in great big letters he wrote: “PAID IN FULL.”

        and me that she wanted a new bicy cle. As Chirstmas drew nearer, her desire for a bicy cle
        seemed to fade, or so we thought. We purchased the latest rage, Baby -Sitter’s Club dolls,
        and a doll house. Then much to our surprise, on December 23rd, she said that she “really
        wanted a bike more than any thing else.”<br/> <br/>
        It was just too late, what with all the details of preparing Christmas dinner and buying lastminute gifts, to take the
        time to select the “right bike” for our little girl. So, here we were -Chirstmas Eve around 9:00 p.m, with Almie Rose and
        her six-year-old brother, Dy lan, nestled snug in their beds. We could now think only of the bicy cle, the guilt, and being
        parents who would disappoint their child.<br/> <br/>
        “What if I make a little bicy cle out of clay and write a note that she could trade the clay model in for a real bike?”
        my husband asked. The theory being that since this is a highticket item and she is “such a big girl,” it would be much
        better for her to pick it out. So he spent the next four hours paintstakingly working with clay to create a miniature bike.<br/> <br/>
        On Chirstmas morning, we were excited for Almie Rose to open the little heart-shaped package with the beautiful
        red and white clay bike and the note. Finally, she opened it and read the note aloud.<br/> <br/>
        “Does this mean that I trade in this bike that Daddy made me for a real one?”
        “Yes.” I said beaming. Almie Rose had tears in her eyes when she replied,<br/> <br/>
        “I could never trade in this beautiful bicy cle that Daddy made me. I’d rather keep this than get a real bike.”<br/> <br/>
        At that moment, we would have moved heaven and earth to buy her every bicy cle on the planet!

        contentEn: `When you see geese flying along in “V” formation, you might consider what science
        has discovered as to why they fly that way. As each bird flaps its wings, it creates an
        uplift for the bird immediately following. By flying in “V” formation, the whole flock
        adds at least 71 percent greater flying range than if each bird flew on its own. <br/><br/> 
        People who share a common direction and sense of community can get where they are
        going more quickly and easily because they are traveling on the thrust of one another. <br/><br/> 
        When a goose falls out of formation, it suddenly feels the drag and resistance of trying to go it alone – and quickly
        gets back into formation to take advantage of the lifting power of the bird in front. <br/><br/> 
        If we have as much sense as a goose, we will stay in formation with those people who are headed the same way
        we are. <br/><br/> 
        When the head goose get tired, it rotates back in the wing and another goose flies point. <br/><br/> 
        It is sensible to take turns doing demanding jobs, whether with people or with geese flying south. <br/><br/> 
        Geese honk from behind to encourage those up front to keep up their speed. <br/><br/> 
        What messages do we give when we honk behind? <br/><br/> 
        Finally – and this is important – when a goose gets sick or is wounded by gunshot, and falls out of formation, two
        other geese fall out with that goose and follow it down to lend help and protection. They stay with the fallen goose until
        it is able to fly or until it dies; and only then do they launch out on their own, or with another formation to catch up
        with their group. <br/><br/>

        teaching process. The instructor asked us to list any thing in our past that we felt ashamed
        of, guilty about, regretted, or incomplete about. <br/><br/> The next week he invited participants to
        read their lists aloud. This seemed like a very private process, but there’s always some
        brave soul in the crowd who will volunteer. As people read their lists, mine grew longer.
        After three weeks, I had 101 items on my list. The instructor then suggested that we find ways to
        make amends, apologize to people, or take some action to right any wrongdoing. I was seriously
        wondering how this could ever improve my communications, having visions of alienating just about everyone from
        my life. <br/><br/> 
        The next week, the man next to me raised his hand and volunteered this story: “While making my list, I
        remembered an incident from high school. I grew up in a small town in Iowa. There was a sheriff in town that none of
        us kids liked. One night, my two buddies and I decided to play a trick on Sheriff Brown. After drinking a few beers, we
        found a can of red paint, climbed the public water tank in the middle of town, and wrote, on the tank, in bright red
        letters:   Sheriff Brown is an s.o.b.   The next day, the town arose to see our glorious sign. Within two hours, Sheriff Brown
        had my two pals and me in his office. My friends confessed and I lied, denying the truth. No one ever found out. <br/><br/> 
        Nearly 20 years later, Sheriff Brown’s name appears on my list. I didn’t even know if he was still alive. Last
        weekend, I dialed information in my hometown back in Iowa. Sure enough, there was a Roger Brown still listed. I
        dialed his number. After a few rings, I heard: “Hello?”  I said: “Sheriff Brown?” Pause. “Y up.” “Well, this is Jimmy
        Calkins. And I want you to know that I did it.” Pause. “I knew it!” he yelled back. We had a good laugh and a lively
        discussion. His closing words were: “Jimmy, I always felt badly for you because your buddies got it off their chest, and
        I knew you were carrying it around all these years. I want to thank you for calling me…for your sake.” <br/><br/> 
        Jimmy inspired me to clear up all 101 items on my lists. It took me almost two years, but became the springboard
        and true inspiration for my career as a conflict mediator. No matter how difficult the conflict, crisis or situation, I
        always remember that it’s never too late to clear up the past and begin resolution.`,

        contentEn: `A little girl whose parents had died lived with her grandmother and slept in an upstairs bedroom.<br/><br/>
        One night, there was a fire in the house and the grandmother perished while trying to rescue
        the child. The fire spread quickly, and the first floor of the house was soon engulfed in flames.<br/><br/>
        Neighbors called the fire department, then stood helplessly by, unable to enter the house because
        flames blocked all the entrances. The little girl appeared at an upstairs window, crying for help, just as word spread
        among the crowd that firefighters would be delayed a few minutes because they were all at another fire.<br/><br/>
        Suddenly, a man appeared with a ladder, put it up against the side of the house and disappeared inside. When he
        reappeared, he had the little girl in his arms. He delivered the child to the waiting arms below, then disappeared into
        the night.<br/><br/>
        An investigation revealed that the child had no living relatives, and weeks later a meeting was held to determine
        who would take the child into their home and bring her up.<br/><br/>
        A teacher said she would like to raise the child. She pointed out that she could ensure her a good education. A
        farmer offered her an upbringing on his farm. He pointed out that living on a farm was healthy and satisfying. Others
        spoke, giving their reasons why it was to the child's advantage to live with them. Finally, the town's richest resident
        arose and said:<br/><br/>
        "I can give this child all the advantages that you have mentioned here, plus money and every thing that money can
        buy.”<br/><br/>
        Throughout all this, the child remained silent, her eyes on the floor.<br/><br/>
        "Does anyone else want to speak?" asked the meeting chairman.<br/><br/>
        A man came forward from the back of the hall. His gait was slow and he seemed in pain. When he got to the front of
        the room, he stood directly before the little girl and held out his arms. The crowd gasped. His hand and arms were
        terribly scarred.<br/><br/>
        The child cried out:<br/><br/>
        "This is the man who rescued me!”<br/><br/>
        With a leap, she threw her arms around the man's neck, holding on for dear life, just as she had that fateful night.
        She buried her face on his shoulder and sobbed for a few moments. Then she looked up and smiled at him.<br/><br/>
        "This meeting is adjourned," said the chairman.

        "Any old papers, lady?”<br/><br/>
        I was busy. I wanted to say no - until I looked down at their feet. Thin little sandals, sopped with sleet.<br/><br/>
        "Come in and I'll make you a cup of hot cocoa."There was no conversation. Their soggy sandals left marks upon
        the hearthstone.<br/><br/>
        Cocoa and toast with jam to fortify against the chill outside. I went back to the kitchen and started again on my
        household budget...<br/><br/>
        The silence in the front room struck through to me. I looked in.<br/><br/>
        The girl held the empty cup in her hands, looking at it. The boy asked in flat voice, "Lady... are you rich?”
        "Am I rich? Mercy, no!" I looked at my shabby slipcovers.<br/><br/>
        The girl put her cup back in its saucer - carefully. "Your cups match your saucers."Her voice was old with a hunger
        that was not of the stomach.<br/><br/>
        They left then, holding their bundles of papers against the wind. They hadn't said thank you. They didn't need to.
        They had done more than that. Plain blue pottery cups and saucers. But they matched. I tested the potatoes and
        stirred the gravy. Potatoes and brown gravy - a roof over our heads - my man with a good steady job - these things
        matched, too.<br/><br/>
        I moved the chairs back from the fire and tidied the living room. The muddy prints of small sandals were still wet
        upon my hearth. I let them be. I want them there in case I ever forget again how very rich I am`,

        terrible state of teens and young adults, based on watching the six o'clock news rather selectively.<br/><br/>
        I gratefully disembarked the plane and bought a local paper on the way to the hotel. There, on an inside page, was
        an article that I believe ought to have been the front-page headline news.<br/><br/>
        The article wrote about a 15-year-old boy with a brain tumor. He was undergoing radiation and chemotherapy
        treatments. As a result of those treatments, he had lost all of his hair. I remember how I would have felt about that at
        his age - I would have been mortified!<br/><br/>
        This young man's classmates spontaneously came to the rescue: all the boys in his grade asked their family if they
        could shave their heads so that Brian wouldn't be the only bald boy in the high school. There, on that page, was a

        engineering miracle. In 1883, a creative engineer, John Roebling, was inspired by an idea for
        this spectacular bridge project. However, bridge-building experts told him to forget it, it just
        was not possible. Roebling convinced his son, Washington, an up-andcoming engineer, that
        the bridge could be built. The two of them conceived the concept of how it could be accomplished, and how to
        overcome the obstacles. Somehow they convinced bankers to finance the project. Now with unharnessed excitement
        and energy, they hired their crew and began to build their dream bridge.<br/><br/>
        The project was only a few months under way when a tragic on-site accident killed John Roebling and severely
        injured his son. Washington was severely brain-damaged, unable to talk or walk. Everyone thought that the project
        would have been scrapped since the Roeblings were the only ones who understood how the bridge could be built.<br/><br/>
        Though Washington Roebling was unable to move or talk, his mind was as sharp as ever. One day, as he lay in his
        hospital bed, an idea flashed in his mind as to how to develop a communication code. All he could move was one
        finger, so he touched the arm of his wife with that finger. He tapped out the code to communicate to her what she was
        to tell the engineers who continued building the bridge. For 13 years, Washington tapped out his instructions with one
        finger until the spectacular Brooklyn Bridge was finally completed`,

        As a child, Mary Groda did not learn to read and write. Experts labeled her retarded. As an adolescent she
        "earned" an additional label, "incorrigible," and was sentenced to two years in a reformatory. It was here, ironically, in

        hard work paid off. She was awarded her (GED) high school diploma.<br/><br/>
        But more misfortune was to visit Mary Groda. After leaving the reformatory, she became pregnant without benefit
        of marriage. Then, two years later a second pregnancy resulted in a stroke, erasing her hard-earned powers of reading
        and writing. With the help and support of her father, Mary battled back, regaining what she had lost.<br/><br/>
        In dire financial straits, Mary went on welfare. Finally, to make ends meet, she took in seven foster children. It was
        during this period that she started taking courses at a community college. Upon completion of her course work, she
        applied to and was accepted by the Albany Medical School to study medicine.<br/><br/>
        In the spring of 1984 in Oregon, Mary Groda Lewis - she's married now - paraded in full academic regalia across
        the graduation stage. No one can know what private thoughts went through Mary's mind as she reached out to grasp
        this eloquent testimony to her self-belief and perseverance, her diploma that announced to all the world: Here stands

        Franklin, complete with costume. One day, I was visiting and talking with pupils of a primary
        school. One student raised his hand and said, "I thought you died."This was not an unusual
        question and I tried to find a suitable answer by saying, "Well, I did die on April 17, 17 90,
        when I was 84 years old, but I didn't like it and I'm never going to do it again.”<br/><br/>
        I immediately asked for any other questions and called on a boy at the back of the room who raised his hand. He
        asked, "When you were in Heaven, did you see my mother there?”<br/><br/>
        My heart stopped. I wanted the floor to open up and swallow me.<br/><br/>
        My only thought was, don't blow this! I realized for an 1 1 -year-old boy to ask that question in front of all of his
        classmates, it had to either be a very recent occurrence or of utmost concern. I also knew I had to saysomething to
        comfort him.<br/><br/>

        The smile on his face told me that it was the right answer. I'm not sure where it came from, but I think I just may

        relationships that I have had with these special kids have been valuable gifts in my life. Let me
        tell you a story about the courage of Tyler.<br/><br/>
        Tyler was born infected with HIV from his mother. From the very beginning of his life, he was
        dependent on medications to enable him to survive. At times, he also needed supplemental oxygen to support his
        breathing.
        Tyler wasn't willing to give up one single moment of his childhood to this deadly disease. It was not unusual to find
        him playing and racing around his backyard, wearing his medicine-laden backpack and dragging his tank of oxygen
        behind him in his little wagon. Tyler's pure joy in being alive gave him energy that caused all of us who knew him to
        marvel. Tyler's mom often recognized that he moved so fast, she dressed him in red. That way, when she peered out
        the window to check on him playing in the yard, she could quickly spot him.<br/><br/>
        This dreaded disease eventually wore down even the likes of a little dynamo like Tyler. He became quite ill and,
        unfortunately, so did his mother. When it became apparent that he wasn't going to survive, Tyler's mom talked to him
        and she comforted him by telling Tyler that she was dying, too, and that she would be with him soon in heaven.<br/><br/>
        A few days before his death, Tyler beckoned me over to his hospital bed and whispered, "I might die soon. I'm not
        scared. When I die, please dress me in red. Mom promised she's coming to heaven, too. I'll be playing when she gets
        there, and I want to make sure she can find me.”`,

        he would say in a falsetto whisper, “It’s going to be a beautiful morning. I hear the birds

        distant hillside, row upon row of corn and wheat, flatlands and valley s, mountains and rolling
        hillsides and city sky lines.<br/><br/>
        But uppermost in our minds is the final destination. On a certain day, we will pull into the station. Bands will be
        playing and flags waving. Once we get there, our dreams will come true and the pieces of our lives will fit together like a
        completed jigsaw puzzle. Restlessly we pace the aisles, damning the minutes - waiting, waiting, waiting for the station.<br/><br/>
        "When we reach the station, that will be it!"we cry. "When I'm 18.” "When I buy a new 450 SL Mercedes Benz!"
        "When I put the last kid through college." "When I have paid off the mortgage!" "When I get a promotion." "When I reach
        retirement, I shall live happily ever after!”<br/><br/>
        Sooner or later, we realize there is no station, no one place to arrive. The true joy of life is the trip. The station is
        only a dream. It constantly outdistances us.<br/><br/>
        "Relish the moment" is a good motto, especially when coupled with Psalm 1 18:24: "This is the day which the Lord
        hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it." It isn't the burdens of today that drive men mad. It is the regrets over
        yesterday and the fear of tomorrow. Regret and fear are twin thieves who rob us of today.<br/><br/>
        So stop pacing the aisles and counting the miles. Instead, climb more mountains, eat more ice cream, go barefoot
        more often, swim more rivers, watch more sunsets, laugh more, cry less. Life must be lived as we go along. The station

        minute. My four small children whirled through, leaving a wake of toys, crumbs and stray

        sky, as he circled the bases with his fist held high. Matthew had just hit his first
        home run as a member of his Little League team - a grand slam on his “Field of
        Dreams!”<br/><br/>
        His father, Mark, had always wanted to be a professional baseball player. He tried out and
        survived several “cuts,” but never lived his dream - a dream instilled and supported by his father, Chet.<br/><br/>
        Despite that, Mark continued to play on sandlot teams and taught neighborhood children how to play. When
        Matthew was born on July 30, 1985, Mark promised himself he would share his dream with his son. By the time
        Matthew was four, he was hitting a baseball over the neighbor’s roof.<br/><br/>
        Matthew’s uniform number 7 - was the same as his father’s. He was so pleased that his daddy loved him, as he
        enjoyed the family tradition. After all, the movie “Field of Dreams,” is not just about base-ball - it’s about fathers and
        sons and it’s about the strength of a faith!<br/><br/>
        Sadly, yet with great faith, Mark bravely faced, but lost, a hard-fought battle with cancer. He was 33. The Sunday
        that Mark died, he had accepted to enter the hospital for “observation only ”. The doctors had promised that he could
        be released to see Matthew’s first game on Monday afternoon.<br/><br/>
        Family and friends knew that Matthew would play the next day, just as his father would have wished. Little did
        Matthew know that the promise he had made to his mother, Sherry, that “My first ball will be hit for my daddy,” would
        be heard by a much higher, ever-present power.<br/><br/>
        The comment that Matthew’s achievement, “probably knocked his father off the cloud from which he was
        watching,” sums up the victories of this life for all of us, doesn’t it?`,

        God was about to intervene in his life. He’d dropped out of school a few weeks earlier to
        have a job delivering pizzas. Described by his teachers and employers as a courteous,
        hard worker, James just couldn’t seem to handle the psy chology cal pressures of
        adolescence. His life was going nowhere fast despite the silent prayers of his mother.<br/><br/>
        Always conscientious, James delivered pizzas hot from the oven until the day, on the way taking pizzas to the
        customer, he saw the back of a Cadillac sinking. The car was going down fast with an elderly man inside. Without
        hesitation, James leaped into the water. Trapped inside was the Reverend Max Kelly. He was unconscious. James,
        standing on the back of the car, saw that a rear window had somehow opened. So, he tried his best to pull the elderly
        man out and brought him to shore.<br/><br/>
        After the rescue, the police offered James a ride home. But he declined, stating that he had his truck to drive and
        pizza to deliver. Ever conscientious, he did ask them to radio the restaurant to notify his customers that their pizzas
        would be a little late and a little cold.<br/><br/>
        In December of 1995, James Hogan was awarded the Carnegie Medal for heroism which included $2,500, and a
        scholarship. James says the incident has changed his life. Just two weeks before the accident, he had held the gun,
        which his father left, to his head wanting to die. He wouldn’t have been there to save the Reverend’s life had the gun not
        jammed.<br/><br/>

        from the bottom of my heart; and when the heavenly bright light approaches, I will pray silently until I cannot pray.<br/><br/>

        It was the familiar Hide and Go Seek,
        Though who’d never have known it to be
        Such a game with an old, old, old, old lady,
        And a boy just past three.<br/><br/>
        Then, the boy would bend his face down
        On his one little sound knee,
        And he’d guess where she was hiding,
        In guesses One, Two, Three!<br/><br/>
        “You are in the cupboard, aren’t you?”
        He would shout, and laugh with glee
        But it wasn’t the cupboard; Ok,
        Cause he still had Two and Three.<br/><br/>
        “You are up in Papa’s big bedroom,
        In the chest with the queer old key!”
        Softly she said: “You are warm and warmer;
        But you’re not quite right, my dear!,” said she.<br/><br/>
        “It can’t be the little cupboard
        Where Mamma’s things used to be?
        So it must be the clothespress, Gran’ma!”
        And he found her with his Three.
        Then she covered her face with her fingers,
        That were thin, wrinkled and wee,
        And she guessed where the boy was hiding,
        With a One and a Two and a Three.
        And they never had stirred from their places,
        Right there, under the oak tree
        This old, old, old, old lady,
        And the boy who was just past three.

        contentEn: `My plan was pretty simple. Not an architectural drawing for a sky scraper or financial
        goals for some certain major sales contracts. I just wanted to get my four kids dressed
        and fed. Then I wanted to get in the car without mishap and drop them off at school on
        time.<br/><br/>
        However, that plan almost always failed.<br/><br/>
        My kids seemed to think the definition of hurry was “Mommy’s getting cranky ”. They each had their own plans,
        which changed from minute to minute and made me crazy.<br/><br/>
        One hopeful morning, my son was actually trying to follow my plan by putting on his shoes... except he couldn’t
        find his shoes. My preschooler was tracing raindrops with her sy rupy finger on the just-polishedy esterday window.
        And my other child was hanging out, watching the rush of others. The baby... well, she always needed a diaper change
        at the very time everyone was finally in the car even when I had turned the key in the ignition. I think I could potty -
        train her with the sound of a starting car instead of the conventional running of water in the bathroom.<br/><br/>
        After dropping off the two elder children, I headed to the nearby grocery store with the two smaller children,
        optimistic that this morning could only get better. I daydreamed about a parking space right in front, plastic vegetable
        bags that open, no-wait deli counters as usual, sales on Cry stal Light and hair color, and a checkout person who is fast,
        friendly, and pleased with my just-expired coupons. What better it can be?<br/><br/>
        And here’s what happened. I wheeled the cart with my smashed-banana-covered baby to the checkout line and
        loaded the conveyor belt with all stuff. Then I fumbled for the coupons and grocery card the checkout person required
        before she would check me out. I told her we had eaten two bananas. The register tape ran out, the baby was pulling
        items off the nearby display stand, and the clerk was trying to figure out how to weigh two bananas that weren’t there,
        oblivious to the fact that I had someplace to go and had to get there quickly.<br/><br/>
        I noticed an older woman behind me with only a few items in her basket. “You may want to go to another line, I
        suggested apologetically.<br/><br/>
        “That’s all right. My kids are all grown, and I have nowhere to rush off to. I’m just enjoying watching your lovely
        family,” she replied with a smile.<br/><br/>
        It was at that moment that I started to understand patience. I was always charging off with my to-do list in hand
        all the times, thinking that when every thing was done, which it never seemed to be, I myself could really enjoy life. Up
        to now, I began to realize that what I was doing everyday was life. So, why didn’t I give myself a chance of enjoying it?
        I understood that patience was the ability to guide my children to growth amid the everydaystuff a mommy does.<br/><br/>
        I still had to get my kids off to school, bath them, feed them and bring them to sleep. But when I just slowed down
        and loved the life I was in, I found patience for myself, my dears!`,

        His mournful wail interrupted the dignified quiet of the ceremony. The other family and
        friends standing around the grave looked shocked and embarrassed cause they could do nothing

        father. “It’s okay, Dad; we understand. Shush.”<br/><br/>
        The old man stared fixedly at the casket lowering slowly into the grave. The clergyman went on. Finishing, he
        invited the family to shovel some dirt onto the coffin as a mark of the finality of death. Each, in turn, did so with the
        exception of the old man. “Oh, how I loved her!” he moaned in distress loudly. His daughter and two sons again tried to
        restrain him, but he continued, “I loved her!”<br/><br/>
        Now, as the rest of those gathered around began leaving the grave, the old man stubbornly resisted. He stayed,
        staring into the grave. Seeing so, the clergyman approached and slowly said. “I know how you must feel, but it’s time
        to leave. We all must leave and go on with life.”<br/><br/>
        “Oh, how I loved her!” the old man moaned, miserably. “You don’t understand,” he said to the clergyman, “I

        you back with us, but knowing that is impossible I will settle for a letter to you: God will
        hopefully hand-deliver it in time for the holiday.<br/><br/>
        I missed having you being here to help me with my Christmas shopping. You always had a sense of what your
        mom liked, etc. However, I managed okay, I think you were probably helping me. Your mom will love the gift you sent
        her from Heaven! Sarah, too!<br/><br/>
        You mom has done a lot of baking this week; uncooked cake, date squares, etc. Surprised, eh? You like it?<br/><br/>
        Our traditional Christmas get-together will be at your Uncle Steve’s place this year. We don’t know how we will
        handle it, but will cross that bridge when we come to it. Don’t you worry!<br/><br/>
        Sarah is doing okay, still dating Brian (who has really helped her improve in study ). We all know she misses you
        mostly at nights, when you two would do so much talking at that moment. She misses her big sister’s advice as well as
        odd spat between both of you! Remember?<br/><br/>
        I have to go to the cemetery tomorrow and shovel snow, in case some of the family want to visit your grave site.
        We decorated the poles, hung a white and paper cranes and a few bells for you to hear when the wind blows and their
        ding – dong will please your ears. It really looks nice. Remember to wake up and enjoy! Jenny, we all know Patrick
        misses you much, and you miss him, too. Sorry I wasn’t more supportive of your relationship; that will bother me until
        I can apologize in person.<br/><br/>
        I’m sorry you never got to experience the Internet, Jenny. But I do believe that you would have loved it! I have
        met some wonderful people online, families that have also lost their son or daughter, etc. They have helped me
        tremendously in coping with your quite unexpected death. Most times, other than your mom, these very virtual men
        have been nearly my biggest release.<br/><br/>
        Losing one’s child is the most pain a parent can experience, and being able to correspond that pain with others in
        the same situation is surely a blessing. Jennifer, we will miss you alway s. We will never stop loving you or ever forget

        love of Mother Nature and of food that they had grown themselves together on a small
        plot of orchard behind her house. Whenever his schedule permitted, he would drop in for
        a short visit and a cup of coffee. One day, when he found no one home, he left a chunk of
        dirt on her porch. This started what was later to be known as his “calling card.” Grandmother would
        come home occasionally and instantly know that Dave had been by when she spotted the chunk of dirt on her porch.<br/><br/>
        Although my Grandmother had a hard childhood and a poor upbringing in Italy, she managed to do well in the
        United States. She was always healthy and independent and knew how to enjoy a fulfilling life. Recently, she had a
        stroke and died. Everyone was so much saddened by her death. To Dave, he was disconsolate. His life-long friend was
        now gone.<br/><br/>
        At her funeral, Dave and I were among the grandsons who were pall-bearers. At the cemetery, we were instructed
        by the funeral director to place our white gloves and the carnation we wore during the ceremony on our
        grandmother’s casket. Then, one by one, each grandson came and paid his final respects. Dave went before me and as
        he walked over to her casket, I saw him quickly lean over to pick up something. I couldn’t see what it was, so I didn’t
        pay too much attention to it. As I went to place my gloves and carnation next to Dave’s, tears suddenly filled my eyes
        as I focused on the chunk of dirt that lay there, on top of my grandmother’s casket. He had left his “calling card” to his

        other crazy, but we also shared much that helped to creat an unbreakable bond between us.
        Everyone who knew Big B adored him. He had a huge heart and always believed in everyone else’s
        goodness - except his own.<br/><br/>
        Big B tutored hundreds of kids who had been labeled by society as stupid, lazy, undisciplined or mentally
        challenged. My brother saw within these children an ability to make a difference to the bad criticisms towards them.
        He himself had a learning disability; it was his secret. Together he and his students knew what it felt like to be treated as
        different ones in a world that had yet to understand or to sympathize.<br/><br/>
        In the last year of Big B’s life he had another challenge to face, his absolute refusal to believe he was worthy of
        love. Big B was a beacon of light to all he touched and everybody knew it - everybody but him.<br/><br/>
        I was determined to prove to him that he was worthy of love. As cancer ravaged his body for the sixth and last
        time, he finally allowed me to enter his world of pain and confusion. During the last weeks of his life, only 80 pounds
        remained of his once 190- pound frame. His eye-lids would not close, he was too weak to blink and his voice was at this
        moment a whisper. All I could do at this time was hold him in my arms and gave him my love. All he could do was
        accept all of it.<br/><br/>
        Day after day, Big B was pampered around the clock and he came to love that. When he was too weak to talk, he
        would tap his fingers to motion me to hold his hand. My brother finally knew how to ask for and receive love! Decades
        of fights, misunderstandings intermingling with the helplessness of each feeling the other was unreachable had
        vanished. In the end, he totally surrendered to the wisdom of a higher power to help him understand the strange
        concept of self-love.<br/><br/>
        During one of our last conversations he secretly whispered to me, “I really am loved, aren’t I?” It was the missing
        piece to his life’s puzzle. He finally realized that he had the right to be loved.`,

        please don’t sit next to me,” I thought. “I’ve got so much work to do.” But a moment later an
        eleven-year-old girl and her nine-year-old brother were climbing over the empty seat next
        to me while the woman and a four-year-old boy sat behind. Almost immediately the older
        children started bickering while the child behind intermittently kicked my seat. Every few minutes
        the boy would ask his sister, “Where are we now?” “Shut up!” she’d snap and their new round of
        squirming and whining would ensue.<br/><br/>
        “Kids have no concept of important work,” I thought, and quietly resented my predicament. Then I differently
        had another thought coming from a father’s heart, against all my testiness up to that moment – so clearly : “They ’re so
        lovely!” Then I immediately countered to myself: “But these kids are brats, and I’ve got important work to do”. Then
        my inner voice simply replied, “Love them as if they were your children.”<br/><br/>
        So as to answer his repeated “Where-are-we-now?” question repeatedly, I turned the screen in front of me to the
        inflight magazine map, in spite of concentrating on my important work.<br/><br/>
        I started to explain our flight path, dividing it into quarter-hour flight increments and together we estimated when
        the flight would land in Dallas.<br/><br/>
        Soon they were telling me about their trip to Seattle to see their father who was in the hospital. As we talked they
        continuously asked about flying, navigation, science and grown-ups’ views about life – things that they heard or saw
        somewhere before. The time passed quickly and my “important” work was left undone.<br/><br/>
        As we were preparing to land, I seemed to remember something and asked how their father was doing now, They
        grew quiet and the boy simply said, “He died.”<br/><br/>
        “Oh, I’m so sorry.”<br/><br/>
        “Y eah, me too. I loved him very much! But it’s my little brother I’m most worried about. He’s taking it real hard.”
        I suddenly realized what we’d really been talking about was the most important work we ever face: living, loving
        and growing in spite of heartbreak. When we said good-by e in Dallas airport, the boy shook my hand and thanked me
        for being his “airline teacher.” And I thanked him for being mine`,

        sends kids running. My daughter just whiningly stared at me, almost afraid to
        speak. When she did start to offer an explanation, I cut her off. “How many times
        have I told you not to bring those paint pots into your room? Do you know how
        much this carpet costs? You’d better do something to wash out that stain right now, OK?”<br/><br/>
        Her eyes began to well up with tears, and I knew she felt bad about spilling the paint, but I was very angry.
        Contemplating the best way to extract red watercolor from a beige carpet, I headed downstairs for some cleaning
        products and towels without taking notice that she still trembled in the corner.<br/><br/>
        When I returned, she was rubbing the stains with a tissues. Now the carpet was flecked with little pieces of white.
        “That’s OK, honey, I’ll do that,” I pretended to be strict, then I sat down and started to remove the stain. “What a
        mess,” I kept on muttering. As I scrubbed, I tried to explain to my daughter why she couldn’t paint in her room. Just
        in case it wasn’t clear, I have to take more explanation. “You can paint just in the kitchen.”<br/><br/>
        After dinner, I told her to take a bath, brush her teeth, and head to her room for bed. “I’ll be right there to tuck
        you in,” I assured her. Even though she knew how to read, each night I used to read a portion of a chapter book to her
        till she felt into her sleep. That night we read and laughed about the silly antics of the naughty children in the story. I
        seemed to forget all the things happened in the morning.<br/><br/>
        Though I switched off her lamp, we could still see by the light coming from the hall. As I leaned down to give her a
        hug and a kiss, then she pulled out a piece of paper from under her pillow. I briefly saw a giant, red heart was painted
        on it. Below the heart, she had carefully written “I love you, Mommy”. The incomplete handwritings of my daughter -
        only a sevenyears- old child moved her mom to tears. Now I knew why she had the paint in her room and made things
        that drove me exceedingly angry. At the bottom of the page, this time with a pen, she had drawn two squares - one
        with yes beside it and the other with a no. Above the boxes she had written the question: “Do you still love me?”<br/><br/>
        She offered me a pencil and waited for me to check off my answer. I filled the yes box with a big, affirmative check.<br/><br/>
        My daughter immediately smiled with relief. “I thought you didn’t love me anymore because I spilled paint on the
        carpet and it made you angry.”<br/><br/>
        I took her in my arms and kissed her lots. “Honey, I will alway slove you. Even when you make me angry, I still
        love you. Remember this!”<br/><br/>
        Up to now, the paint never completely came out of the carpet, but I don’t mind. The spot faded to a light pink that
        seems to me to resemble the vague shape of a heart. Now every time I go into my daughter’s room, that stain reminded
        me to tell her “I love you.” No matter what.`,

        emotionally available or capable of making a long-term commitment. Those of my
        relationships were full of pain I didn’t find my own true love. Now, I wanted to get married so
        I knew I had to do something radically different.<br/><br/>
        One day, I decided to pray as follows: “God, I don’t know how to pick the right partner, so
        please, please choose my Divine Beloved for me, and prepare us both for our upcoming union. And God, just so I’m
        sure to know who you’ve chosen for me, let him somehow present me with a blue rose.”
        Everyday after that for five months, I affirmed that my Divine Beloved was coming to me, and that we would
        recognize each other at the right time.
        Everyday, I let go of a little more control and opened a little more to God loving me. Everyday, I looked for my
        blue rose.<br/><br/>
        Twelve days after I left my abusive boy friend, I attended a luncheon where happened an exciting talk show by
        Alan Cohen. He spoke about the power within us that enables each of us to bless another human being. It touched me
        so deeply that when he invited us all to do a blessing exercise, I was the first to jump out of my chair. Over 100 people
        around me scrambled to find a partner to practice that prayer.<br/><br/>
        Suddenly things became quiet. A young blue-eyed man stood in front of me. We joined hands and gazed into each
        other’s eyes. Following Alan’s instruction, I asked, “Will you bless me?” Though he said nothing for several minutes, I
        knew he silently poured unconditional love and blessings onto my heart thirsty for love for so long. He then gently
        asked, “Will you bless me?” and I returned the love. We side by side kept that such silence and didn’t say any thing else
        to each other.<br/><br/>
        The exercise ended and we returned to our seats. I was in a daze. In a few minutes, the young man returned and
        introduced himself as David Rose. And in that exactly moment, I knew that God himself had presented me with my
        blueeyed Rose.<br/><br/>

        When your father never says them to you when you are a child, it gets tougher and
        tougher for him to say those words as he gets older. To tell the truth, I could not
        honestly remember when I had last said those words to him either. Then, I decided to set
        my ego aside and make the first move. After some hesitation, in our next phone conversation I
        blurted out the words, “Dad... I love you!”<br/><br/>
        There was a silence at the other end and he awkwardly replied, “Well, same back at ya!”<br/><br/>
        I chuckled and said, “Dad, I know you love me so much”.<br/><br/>
        Fifteen minutes later my mother called and nervously asked, “Paul, is every thing okay?”
        A few weeks later, Dad concluded our phone conversation with the words, “Paul, I love you”. I was at work during
        this conversation, and the tears were rolling down my cheeks as I finally “heard” the love that Dad did give me. As we
        both sat there in tears we realized that this special moment had taken our father and son relationship to a new level.<br/><br/>
        A short while after this special moment, my father fortunately escaped death following heart surgery. Many times
        since, I have pondered the thought, if that time I did not take the first step and Dad did not survive the surgery, maybe
        I extremely regret because I would have never “heard” the love.

        contentEn: `So, how do you develop a relationship?” This question was asked of me when I was doing a
        Relationship Service seminar for the YMCA. I have to admit that the question was
        completely out of my preparation. We had been talking “theory ” from the beginning to
        that moment, but this woman wanted some concrete methods for developing client or,
        for that matter, any relationship.<br/><br/>
        After pausing for a minute to collect my thoughts, I stated that the only thing I could do was tell her the truth
        from my experience. Somewhat shy ly, I began to tell her the story of how my wife and I saved our relationship. My
        mind started to flash back to a time when Karen and I together attended a State Fair a few years ago. There, I
        fortunately won two red velvet hearts as a consolation prize in one of the midway games. I remember, at that time I
        broke apart the two hearts and gave one to Karen and kept one for myself.<br/><br/>
        We had been married for 10 years, and we were going through a bit of a “flat spot” in our relationship. We still
        loved each other, but something was missing in our couple life. We all knew that. I paid no attention, but Karen – my
        wife, didn't.<br/><br/>
        Karen did not want the “flatness” to continue so one dayshe came up with a plan. She took one of the hearts stored
        in the cupboard for a long time and hid it in my towel, while I was taking a shower. When I went to grab my towel, the
        red heart suddenly spilled out. As I bent down to pick it up, the warmth of its red colour waked me up. It made me
        flash back to the time when I won the red hearts at the former fair as well as the passionate love Karen and I felt for
        each other at that moment. Holding the red heart in my hands, a current of fresh emotion as a wave watered my solong-stunted soul. I calmly recalled all the bygone days and smiled.<br/><br/>
        I then hid the heart in her dressingchest drawer. Then, she hid it in my wardrobe. I hid it in the refrigerator. She
        wrapped it in plastic wrap and hid it in the peanut butter. We seemed to play hide and seek together, finding where to
        hide the heart became as much fun as finding it. Each time we hid or found that love red heart was a moment to be
        treasured, it’s also meaningful like the first moment we fell in love, or the first moment we kissed, or the first moment
        we looked at our newborned child. Each is a cherished and precious moment.<br/><br/>
        So “How do you improve and develop a relationship?“ The answer is so simple: Take one moment at a time in your
        life!”`,

        contentEn: `e were on our way to visit an institution in 1954 with our three daughters: Mary, twelve,
        Joan, nine, and Ruth, eighteen months old. Because of our little Ruth, handicapped since
        birth, we were making this sad and silent trip. We had been advised to place her in a
        special home. “It will be less of a burden for your family,” “I think Ruth will be better off
        with children like herself,” “You will have more time to look after your other children without notice
        to a disabled person.”<br/><br/>
        To break the silence, I flipped on the car radio and accidentally heard the voice of a former classmate. I
        remembered him as a boy without legs. He now became president of an organization employing persons who are
        disabled.<br/><br/>
        On the radio, he started to tell about his childhood and of a conversation with his mother. “When it was time for
        another handicapped child to be born,” his mother explained, “the Lord and his counselors held a meeting to decide
        where he should be sent... where there would be a family to love him. Well, our family was chosen.”<br/><br/>
        At this, my wife - Edna leaned over and turned off the radio, gently said. “Let’s go home.” Her eyes shined with
        unshed tears. I touched Ruth’s tiny face. She looked like a beautiful symbol of innocence. I knew at that moment Ruth
        was given to us for a very clear purpose. How miraculous it was that the voice of a friend, with whom I’d had no
        contact for twenty years, should the broadcast program on that dayspeak to me? Mere coincidence? Or was it God’s
        unseen hand helping us hold on to a little girl who would enrich our lives immeasurably in the years that followed?<br/><br/>
        That night, Edna could not sleep. She awoke at three o’clock in the morning with thoughts that demanded to be
        written. And in the morning, I saw a pad on the night-table, we pieced Edna’s notes together into the poem, “Heaven’s
        Very Special Child”: <br/><br/> <i>
        A meeting was held quite far from Earth;
              “It’s time again for another birth.”<br/>
              Said the angels to the Lord above,<br/>
              “This special child will need many times of love.<br/>
              ‘Cause her progress may seem very slow,<br/>
              And accomplishments she may show, by no means.<br/>
              And she’ll require extra care<br/>
              From the folks she meets way down there.<br/>
              She may not run or laugh or play,<br/>
              Her thoughts may seem quite far away<br/>
              With the strange world around her.<br/>
              In many ways she won’t adapt,<br/>
              And she’ll be known as handicapped.<br/>
              So let’s be careful where she’s sent,<br/>
              Cause we want her life to be content.<br/>
              Please, Lord, find the parents who<br/>
              Will do a special job for you.<br/>
              They will not realize right away<br/>
              The leading role they’re asked to play,<br/>
              But with this child sent from above<br/>
              Come stronger faith and richer love.<br/>
              And soon they’ll know the privilege given<br/>

        my father is truly grateful.<br/><br/>
        I was crying the last time she did speak to him. I saw the exchange though I could
        not hear the words. His whisperings, her whisperings.<br/><br/>
        The two of them silhouetted against the window light at the end of the room. My father leaning over my mother’s
        gurney, pressed forehead to forehead. The word “Surgery ” on the doors behind them forming a caption for the picture
        they made. Hands clasped together as if believing they held each other’s hearts. As longingly as the first time they had
        reached for each other, as desperately as two lovers being forced apart.<br/><br/>
        Being forced to part on this day of life and death.<br/><br/>
        They had made the decision together, to do or die... to do and die. These two who had lived for and in each other’s
        dreams these past forty years. How could they help being apart?<br/><br/>
        My mother suddenly had a disease that was cutting the blood flow to her brain. It was deteriorating her life and
        doctors said that it would take it in three years. They also said her life could be prolonged if the surgery was done now.
        Twelve brave hearts had gone before her but only three of them had walked away.<br/><br/>
        I anxiously watched their process of decision making. My mother wanting to live, wanting to try. She was
        determined to fight until the last moment!<br/><br/>
        How brave we knew she was; we three sisters gathered around her hospital bed, witnessing my mother fluttered in
        pain and feeling time pushing us toward her fate the next day. We smiled slow to leave, hoping our “Good nights” were
        not our good-byes.<br/><br/>
        Our father was left to keep his loving vigil. It was painful to leave him that night, too painful to think of him alone
        looking at my mother in coma, waiting for the death to come. But he reminded us that he would not be alone, at least
        for this night, he had her Love.<br/><br/>
        And morning came. We gathered and prayed for mom. We kissed on her brow and silently followed her gurney
        until we were told that only one of us could go any farther.<br/><br/>
        My father continued to walk alongside her as he always had. Two people who had stood together against all odds.
        My mother orphaned at a young age and moved from place to place for food. My father the youngest of nine in a family
        hurting with poverty. They who had found and protected each other in a very happy family.<br/><br/>
        We children were born and grown up amidst the love of that happy house. Given by these two what they had not
        been given in their own childhoods: safety, nurturing, moral guidance.<br/><br/>
        We knew that we were created from their love but that their love was an entity separate from us.
        I see the kiss, the parting. My mother was wheeled through the door, alone. My father, his back to me, placing his
        hand on that door, praying love and, strength and hope to his beloved woman.<br/><br/>
        He turned and walked slowly toward me. The sunrise lit his tired face. At that very moment, I glimpsed how deep
        the love he gave her is.<br/><br/>
        This love of great self-sacrificing. A love so great that he was willing to bear the pain of being far away of his dear
        love, walk alone the rest and upbring the children.<br/><br/>
        Despite our advice, he kept on waiting for my mother’s revivification alone after her two-week-coma. It was the
        months of waiting, doubt, anxiety as well as our hope for her rehabilitation.<br/><br/>
        In the end, my mother had lost her speech but she had won her fight to live. She has not spoken to my father for
        five years, but for that, he is truly grateful.

        progressively getting worse. During one of our conversations, Gay le expressed that one
        of her top secret childhood wishes was to have a red wagon. As a child she could never
        make it come true, because she believed that if you told your greatest birthday wish it
        wouldn’t come true. However, whenever her birthday came, Gay le was too happy to forget all about
        it. As a result, my dear friend had not had any red wagon so far.<br/><br/>
        I was at a small ice cream stand one day and suddenly saw one of weekly drawing’s prize as a miniature red wagon
        that looked so nice and lively. “I’m able to help Gay le!”, excitedly yell to myself.<br/><br/>
        Since then, I began to like ice-cream. Every time making a purchase at this stand, I could fill out a ticket for a
        chance to win. And weekly drawing will be held every Sunday morning. After several weeks waiting for those Sunday
        mornings, spending a lot of savings on buying a lot of ice cream cones, I didn’t win even a time.<br/><br/>
        Then I decided to get up the courage to ask the person in charge if I could buy one of those red wagons. I got near
        to the window to get into conversation with him whose face was familiar to me for a while. I began to tell my friend’s
        story, and that, I wanted to buy one of his. As talking to the stand owner, I could feel my throat tighten and my eyes
        overflowed with tears. Somehow I managed to persuade him to sell the wagon. In fact, the miniature red wagon was so
        long that it didn’t really matter if lacking of one. On collecting all the money left inside my pockets to him, I was
        pleased to receive the new “item” just successfully negotiated and brought it home. The wagon was delivered the next
        day, and for Gay le, my action made her dream come true. The following day of that special day, I received a letter that
        read:<br/><br/>
        Dear Bonnie,<br/><br/>
        Every once in a while there is an opportunity to pass on a kindness - no questions asked. I lost my parents to
        cancer also six months apart from each other. I cared for both of them but could not have done it without the love
        and generosity of friends - really good friends.<br/><br/>
        The best to you and your friend.<br/><br/>

        great athlete before his accident and in a testimony to his talent of sports and
        determination of overcoming his fate, he decided to try a brand new sport, a sport he never

        Through determination and a deep love for the game he did a miracle - becoming the National Blind Golf
        Champion! Moreover, he won that honor 13 times. Very few people knew that one of his heroes was the great golfer
        Ben Hogan, so it truly was an honor for Charlie to win the Ben Hogan Award in 1958.<br/><br/>
        Upon meeting Ben Hogan for the first time, Charlie was awestruck Hogan’s talent and stated that he had one wish
        and it was to have one round of golf with the great Ben Hogan.<br/><br/>
        Mr. Hogan agreed that playing a round together would be an honor for him as well, as he had heard about all of
        Charlie’s accomplishments. Hogan said that he truly admired Charlie’s skills – the one with will of iron.
        “Would you like to play for money, Mr. Hogan?” blurted out Charlie when talking with Hogan.<br/><br/>
        “I can’t play you for money, it wouldn’t be fair!” immediately said Mr. Hogan.<br/><br/>
        “Aw, come on, Mr. Hogan $1,000 per hole!”<br/><br/>

        golfer, unable to be surprised by this rather interesting offer.<br/><br/>

        vowed, “Next week, I’m going to get out of bed. I’m going to walk.” And Glenn did just that.<br/><br/>
        His mother tells of how she used to push back the curtain and look out the window to watch Glenn reach up and
        take hold of an old plow in the yard. With a hand on each handle, he began to struggle to make his gnarled and twisted
        legs function. And with every step a step of pain, his face was continuously twisted and he was bathed in sweat. But he
        was consistent. He came closer to walk and soon after that, he walked almost normally. And like a miracle, he run.
        When he started to run, on his legs with interlacing scalds, he became even more determined.<br/><br/>
        “I always believed that I could walk, and I did. Now I’m going to run faster than anybody has ever run.” And did
        he ever prove that he actually did it.<br/><br/>

        contentEn: `Several years ago, I found myself a long way from home in a narrow prison cell thousands of
        miles far away. As a prisoner of war, I was tortured, humiliated, starved and left to languish
        in squalor for six years.<br/><br/>
        It’s important that in such a hard circumstance, you still get a vivid mental picture of this scene. Try your best to
        smell the stench in the small bucket I called my toilet and taste the salt in the corners of my mouth from my sweat, my
        tears and my blood. And even feel the baking tropical heat in a tin roofed prison cell—not that you’ll ever be a P.O.W.<br/><br/>
        If I am effective in these few moments we spend together, you’ll see that the same kind of challenges you face as a
        teenager, a student, a leader, or a parent, are the same basic challenges I faced in a dark prison cell full of mishap:
        feelings of fear, loneliness, failure and a breakdown of communication. More importantly, your response to those
        challenges will be the same response I had to have in the prison camp just for a purpose seemed to be normal – to be
        survived.<br/><br/>
        What qualities do you have within you that would allow you to survive in a prison camp? Please pause here, think
        about this question, and write in the margin of this page at least five different qualities necessary for survival. (If
        you’ve written faith, commitment or dedication, you’ve already broken the code.)<br/><br/>
        As I worked my way through the first several months and then years of imprisonment, I found I already had a
        foundation of survival tools learned this life from my parents, preachers, youth leaders, and teachers. And the lifesaving skills I used in that prison camp had more to do with my value sy stem, integrity and religious faith than
        any thing I had learned from a textbook.<br/><br/>
        Sound like your life? The adversities you face in your life can be just as debilitating to you as six years of misery in
        a prison camp could have been to me. Now here’s the test: The next time you have a huge problem facing you, turn
        back to this page and read not my writing but your writing in the margin. You’ll find that the same factors you’ve
        written here, which wouldn’t only serve you well if you were unluckily in a prison camp but would certainly serve you
        even better in the challenge of everyday life`,

        tourists, we naturally visited the Blarney Castle. And of course, when you visit the Blarney
        Castle, you kiss the Blarney Stone, a very big stone laying on the towering mountain, to pray
        for blessings. Well, to get to the Blarney Stone, you have to walk up several flights of narrow
        stairs.<br/><br/>
        I have always had a fear of heights and am very claustrophobic, so I told my husband to go without me and then
        let me know if I could do it. When my husband got back to watch over me, I partly gasped partly asked him, “Well,
        what do you think? Do you think I can do it?” and before he could answer, two little old ladies came up to me and said,
        “Honey, if we can do it, you can do it!” So, I tried to hold my steps leaving behind my fear of heights and going ahead.
        At last, we set foot on the peak and together kissed the wonderous Blarney Stone!<br/><br/>
        About a month after I returned from Ireland, I found out a terrible truth - I had breast cancer. I needed
        chemotherapy as soon as possible to prevent cancer cells from spreading. The doctor was obligated to tell me all the
        things that might happen to me even the worst, as a result of the chemotherapy. He said I might lose my hair, I might
        become violently sick to my stomach, I might have severe diarrhea, I might run a high fever, my jaw might lock, and
        so on. Then he asked, “Are you ready to start?” Oh y eah! I really felt ready to start now!<br/><br/>
        While my husband and I were sitting in the waiting room, waiting for my treatment, I suddenly became very
        anxious and scared. I turned to him and said, “Do you think I can do this?” Sitting across from us were two little old
        ladies who had just completed their chemo treatment! Their faces seemed to have no sore. At that moment, my
        husband tenderly took my hand and caressingly said, “Doll, I believe this is going to be just like we were at the Blarney
        Castle! If they can do it, you can do it!” And I did it!<br/><br/>
        Do you know the really neat thing about courage? It shows up when you need it!

        contentEn: `Linda Birtish literally gave herself away. Linda was an outstanding teacher who felt that if
        she had spare time, she would often create great art and poetry. When she was 28,
        however, she began to get severe headaches. Then one day, her doctors discovered that
        she had an enormous brain tumor. They told her that her chances of surviving an
        operation were about 2 percent. Therefore, rather than operate immediately, they
        decided to wait for six months.<br/><br/>
        None better than herself, she knew she had great artistry in her. So during those six months waiting for a chance to
        win the death, she tirelessly rushed to write and drew feverishly. All of her poetry, except one piece, was published in
        famous magazines. All of her art, except one piece, was shown and sold to many people at some of the leading galleries.
        In her bright color art, there were always an aspiration to live and an optimistic point of view in her poetry even if the
        fate turned its back on her.<br/><br/>
        At the end of six months awaiting, Linda finally had the operation. The night before that very special day, she
        decided to literally give herself away. In case of her death, she wrote a “will” in which she donated all of her body parts
        to those who needed them more than she would.<br/><br/>
        Unfortunately, the operation was fatal. Subsequently, her eyes went to an eye bank in Bethesda, Mary land, and
        from there to a recipient in South Carolina. And a young man, age 28, went from darkness to sight. That young man
        and his family were so profoundly grateful that he wrote to the eye bank thanking them for helping him to see again. It
        was only the second “thank you” that the eye bank had received after giving out in excess of 30,000 eyes!<br/><br/>
        Furthermore, he said he wanted to thank the family of the donor’s eyes. He thought they must indeed be
        magnificent folks to have a child who would give away her eyes. The doctors gave him Linda’s address and he decided
        to fly immediately to see his donor on Stalen Island. After looking for the right house, he arrived unannounced to
        Linda’s family and rang the doorbell. After hearing his introduction as well as the purpose of this trip, Mrs. Birtish was
        touched to reach out and embraced him and said, “Young man, if you’ve got nowhere to stay, my husband and I would
        love for you to spend your weekend with us.<br/><br/>
        That young man happily stayed at their house. When Mrs. Birtish took him to look around Linda’s room, he saw a
        Plato’s book on Linda’s bookshelf. He’d also read Plato in Braille. Then he realized she had read Hegel. Once again, he’d
        read Hegel in Braille.<br/><br/>
        The next morning, Mrs. Birtish was gently looking at him and said, “You know, I’m sure I’ve seen you somewhere
        before, but I don’t know where.”<br/><br/>
        All of a sudden she remembered. She ran upstairs and pulled out the last picture - also the only one that Linda had
        never sold when she was alive. It was a portrait of her ideal man that she met in her dreams.<br/><br/>
        Surprisingly, the face in that picture was virtually identical to this young man who had received Linda’s eyes.<br/><br/>
        Then Linda’s mother read him a passage in the last poem Linda had written on her deathbed:<br/><br/>
        Two hearts passing in the dream.<br/><br/>

        author: `Frances E. Leslie`,
        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `Is the lady talked in monotony, I tried to look around the beautiful room around us instead of
        on her words. For she was telling me about Dorothy, her eight-year-old daughter, the middle
        one of her five children, a mentally retarded child.<br/><br/>
        “She’s never spoken a single word,” the mother repeated. “The doctors say it’s hopeless.
        We took her up to Boston last year and....”<br/><br/>
        I fixed my thoughts on the green damask draperies framing tall windows that looked out on Park Avenue. How
        handsome the whole room was, with its cry stal chandeliers, its concert-grand piano, its fresh flowers everywhere.
        What a lovely woman the mother was, an opera singer whose name I had known even before her letter came asking me
        if I would consider a job with Dorothy.<br/><br/>
        Yes, a lovely woman and especially her love for this little girl whom all the experts said should be put away. So,
        the love was the thing to concentrate on. And so while pretending to listen, I closed my ears to the results of reflex
        tests and encephalograms. In my years of working with retarded children I had discovered that my attention must not
        go to the lacks but to the special strengths of such children.<br/><br/>
        There was strength in each one of them, I was sure. I believe that a little of God lives in every one of us, and that to
        bring it out is the only job of any teacher.<br/><br/>
        Dorothy and I met the next weekend. With me it was love at first sight: this beautiful, blonde, blue-eyed child
        surely a very lovely person lived in such a form. Nevertheless, Dorothy only stared at me with inscrutable eyes.<br/><br/>
        “It’s one of her quiet days, thank heaven,” her mother said. “On her wild ones, there’s no controlling her.” My
        mind considered those wild days. I liked the sound of them. They told me there was a person here trapped in prison
        but an individual struggling to be seen and recognized. I told her mother I would try the job for a month.<br/><br/>
        It was a hard one from the beginning. In the afternoons I would take Dorothy to a special class for retarded
        children. She just sat in a chair, staring straight ahead, making no effort to join in the activities.<br/><br/>
        “She’s unreachable,” her teacher told me. “I don’t know why they keep sending her.”<br/><br/>
        I gazed around the room at the other children, all engrossed in simple mechanical tasks, and I silently agreed with
        Dorothy. What was challenging’about fitting a square peg into a square hole? Hence, with her parents’ per mission we
        stopped going there.<br/><br/>
        Dorothy’s problem, it seemed to me, was the nonexpectation of everyone around her. I remember breakfast one
        morning when the other four children and their nurse had come into town. The others quickly finished their cereal but
        Dorothy, dazzled by the activity around her, hadn’t touched hers.<br/><br/>
        “Just spoon it into her!” the nurse cried impatiently.<br/><br/>
        “She can eat by herself,” I said. “I guess she’s just too interested in what’s going on.”<br/><br/>
        “Interested?” Nurse gave a snort of contempt. “She doesn’t have any more idea what’s happening than that
        canary. It’s a shame she’s allowed at the table. She just upsets the other children.”<br/><br/>
        It wasn’t true. Dorothy’s brothers and sisters especially her older sister Martha seemed genuinely happy to be
        with her. But even Martha had fallen into Nurse’s habit of talking about her (“Dorothy looks nice today.” “Dorothy’s
        hair needs combing. Shall I do it?”) rather than to her. It was so easy to assume that because she had no words she had
        no understanding either.<br/><br/>
        I understood the problem. I felt it most during our daily walk in Central Park. It was October, warm sunny
        summer, and Dorothy and I spent hours just walking. When the silence threatened to absorb us both, I sang.
        I started with the hymns I remembered from my own childhood back in England. Dorothy seemed to like the
        songs, for her feet marched in time to the music and her head nodded rhy thmically.<br/><br/>
        We also brought sketch pads and crayons to the park. I was fascinated by some drawings I had found in Dorothy’s
        room, a pattern of graceful waving lines, drawn over and over again. What it meant I had no idea, but it certainly
        wasn’t “scribble” as Nurse impatiently called it.<br/><br/>
        And so we would sit on a park bench and sketch. I drew trees and strolling people and the loft sky line beyond the
        park, and Dorothy drew good-natured pigeons. I saw the very first time what they were, not perhaps the outside of
        pigeons like other people draw, but the souls of the birds instead, the veryway it feels to be lovely and good-natured
        pigeons. Faster than my eyes could follow, her hand moved: the wings in flight, the thrust for the neck, the selfimportant walk.<br/><br/>
        The golden autumn passed too swiftly. Then a day dawned when the rain streamed down the windows and wind
        rattled the doors, Dorothy sat on the piano bench beside me as I sang the songs I had sung in the park. I started off
        with one of Fenwicke Holme’s “Songs of the Silence.”<br/><br/>
        Halfway through this joyous song the miracle happened. One moment I was singing alone, the next Dorothy was
        singing with me, word for word in perfect tune. Electrified, I played on and on without a break, praying that the spell
        would not be broken. What a memory! How marvelously her mind had retained the words of song after song far better
        than an average eight-year-old!<br/><br/>
        I heard someone sob. I turned and saw Dorothy’s mother in the doorway, tears streaming down her cheeks,
        unable to do any thing but hold out her arms to her child.<br/><br/>
        From that moment on, life was different for Dorothy. From singing, it was not far to speaking, although words with
        music always came first. We made up songs for every thing.<br/><br/>
        “Water, a washcloth, see what I mean? Knees that are dirty will soon be clean!” “At the planetarium I can watch
        the stars; There is Venus, here is Mars.”<br/><br/>
        Other changes took place in Dorothy. Her tensions disappeared along with the frustrations of a spirit; so did her
        wildness. The nurse never adjusted to the difference in her and took another job.<br/><br/>
        I lengthened my stay : just another month until she learned the alphabet. When I left, Dorothy was a poised, selfsufficient thirteen-year-old.
        Normal? Not if normal means “average.” All of us have strong points and weak points, and in Dorothy every thing
        is extreme. But this means extremes of knowing and expressing that most of us never reach.<br/><br/>
        Those wavy lines, for instance, the ones she drew again and again, when she had enough words she told me,
        “That’s what the wind looks like.”<br/><br/>
        Dorothy, your eyes see deep down, spiritual things. Your ears hear silent things, your world is set to music. Oh, if
        God left something out of you, it was only to fill it with himself`,

        contentEn: `When I was growing up, I had an old neighbor named Dr. Gibbs. He didn’t look like any
        doctor I’d ever known. Every time I saw him, he wore denim overalls and a straw hat, the
        front brim of which was green sunglass plastic. He smiled a lot, a smile that matched his
        hat old and crinkly and well worn. He never yelled at us for playing in his yard. I
        remember him as someone who was a lot nicer than circumstances warranted.<br/><br/>
        When Dr. Gibbs wasn’t saving lives, he was planting trees. His house sat on ten acres, and his life’s goal was to make
        it a forest.<br/><br/>
        The good doctor had some interesting theories concerning plant husbandry. He came from the “no pain, no gain”
        school of horticulture. He never watered his new trees, which flew in the face of conventional wisdom. Once I asked
        why. He said that watering plants spoiled them, and that if you water them, each successive tree generation will grow
        weaker and weaker. So you have to make things rough for them and weed out the weenie trees early on.<br/><br/>
        He talked about how watering trees made for shallow roots, and how trees that weren’t watered had to grow deep
        roots in search of moisture. I took him to mean that deep roots were strong and adaptable.<br/><br/>
        So he never watered his trees. He’d plant an oak and, instead of watering it every morning, he’d beat it with a
        rolled-up newspaper. Smack! Slap! Pow! I asked him why he did that, and he said it was to get the tree’s attention.<br/><br/>
        Dr. Gibbs went to glory a couple of years after I left home. Every now and again, I walk by his house and look at
        the trees that I’d watched him plant some twenty-five years ago. They ’re granite strong now. Big and robust. Those
        trees wake up in the morning and beat their chests and drink their coffee black.<br/><br/>
        I planted a couple of trees a few years back. Carried water to them for a solid summer. Sprayed them. Prayed over
        them. The whole nine yards. Two years of coddling has resulted in trees that expect to be waited on hand and foot.
        Whenever a cold wind blows in, they tremble and chatter their branches. Sissy trees.<br/><br/>
        Funny thing about those trees of Dr. Gibbs’s. Adversity and deprivation seemed to benefit them in ways comfort
        and ease never could.<br/><br/>
        Every night before I go to bed, I check on my two Sons. I stand over them and watch their little bodies, the rising
        and falling of life within. I often pray for them. Mostly I pray that their lives will be easy. “Lord, spare them from
        hardship.” But lately I’ve been thinking that it’s time to change my prayer.<br/><br/>
        This change has to do with the inevitability of cold winds that hit us at the core. I know my children are going to
        encounter hardship, and my praying they won’t is naive. There’s always a cold wind blowing somewhere.<br/><br/>
        So I’m changing my eventide prayer. Because life is tough, whether we want it to be or not. Instead, I’m going to
        pray that my sons’ roots grow deep, so they can draw strength from the hidden sources of the eternal God.<br/><br/>
        Too many times we pray for ease, but that’s a prayer seldom met. What we need to do is pray for roots that reach
        deep into the Eternal, so when the rains fall and the winds blow, we won’t be swept asunder`,

        brood. And, in fact, our life often reflected the austere setting of boot camp. The five of us were
        crammed into close quarters a two-bedroom apartment in New Jersey and we lived a life of selfdeprived discipline. I couldn’t afford any of the niceties and luxuries other parents did, and aside
        from my mother, none of the rest of our family was involved in the kids’ lives at all.<br/><br/>
        That left me as commander in chief. Many nights, I lay awake on my bed, planning strategies to get more things for
        my children. Though my children never complained about what they lacked and seemed to bask in my love, I was
        continually on the alert for ways to improve their simple lives. When I found a five-bedroom apartment in a threestory house the second and third stories belonging completely to us I leapt at the opportunity. At last, we could
        spread out. The home even had a big backyard.<br/><br/>
        The landlord promised to have every thing fixed up for us in a month. I agreed on the repairs, paid her in cash for
        the first month’s rent and the same in security, and hurried home to inform my troops we were moving out. They were
        excited, and we all camped on my bed that night, planning what we’d do to the new home.<br/><br/>
        The next morning, I gave notice to my current landlord and started packing. We loaded our boxes with the
        precision of a well-oiled machine. It warmed my heart to see the troops in action.<br/><br/>
        And then I realized my strategic error. I had no keys to the new house in hand, and when day after day of
        unreturned phone calls and fruiless searches produced no access to the house, I began to panic. I did some espionage
        work and called the utility company. They told me some one else had just requested new service for the same address.
        I’d been duped.<br/><br/>
        With a heavy heart, I looked at my children’s expectant faces and tried to find the words to tell them the bad news.
        They took it staunchly, though I fought back tears of disappointment.<br/><br/>
        Already feeling defeated, I faced even worse obstacles. I couldn’t afford rent on a new place because I’d paid so
        much for the house. My mother wanted to help, but children were not allowed in her small apartment. Desperate, I
        asked a fellow veteran fighter to help: a single mother of five who was struggling as much as I. She tried her best to be
        hospitable, but nine kids in four rooms... Well, you get the picture.<br/><br/>
        After three weeks, we were all mutinous. We had to get out. I had no options left, no new orders to follow. We were
        on the run. I stored our furniture, stuffed our winter clothes in the back of our yellow Escort, and informed my small
        soldiers that we had nowhere to camp for the present time except in our car.<br/><br/>
        My sons, six and ten, met my gaze and listened intently.<br/><br/>
        “Why can’t we stay at Grandma’s?” my oldest asked. That question was followed by several suggestions of others
        we should be able to stay with. In each case, I had to tell them the harsh truth.<br/><br/>
        “People have their own lives, Honey. We have to handle this on our own. We can do this.”<br/><br/>
        But if my bravado appeased them, it didn’t fool me. I needed strength. Where could I get help?<br/><br/>
        Knowing it was time to turn in for the night, I gathered up my troops, and we marched to the car. The children
        were calm and compliant, but my thoughts were engaged in fierce warfare. Should I do this to them? What else could I
        do?<br/><br/>
        Unexpectedly, it was my own troops who gave me the strength I needed. As we lived in our car for the next four
        weeks, showering at my mother’s in the mornings and eating at fast-food joints, the kids seemed to enjoy the odd
        routine. They never missed a day of school, never complained and never questioned my judgment. They were so
        certain of their commander’s wisdom that even I began to feel courageous. We could manage this! We parked in a
        different spot each night, well-lighted areas near apartment buildings. When the nights grew cold, the kids cuddled in
        the back seat that folded down into a bed, sharing body heat and blankets. I sat in the front, keeping watch between
        dozes and starting the motor every so often to run the heat.<br/><br/>
        When I had earned enough to afford rent someplace, I couldn’t find any apartments that would accept four
        children, so we checked into a hotel. It was like being on a fantastic furlough. We were thrilled, reveling in the heat, the
        beds, the safety. We sneaked in our rations to cook and learned to prepare savory meals with a two-burner hot plate.
        We cooled dairy items in the bathtub. (Hotels have lots of ice.)<br/><br/>
        Finally, many months later, the landlord of the promised house sent me a money order refunding all that was due
        me, with many apologies. I used the money to find us an apartment.<br/><br/>
        That was thirteen years ago. I’m sharing command now with a husband, and we keep our children in a wonder
        fully large house. Every morning, when I run the inspection on my troops taller now, I think back on the horrible
        enemy of desperation that we fought and defeated together. And then I thank God for my small soldiers: a courageous,
        tough little crew who never stumbled in their frightening march. Their bravery was the stuff of the greatest of heroes`,

        contentEn: `My adventure began in October 1966, when Miss Neff, my occupational therapist, took me
        into her stale, windowless room. She was a thirty-year-old woman barely above five feet
        tall, but she could make a student who was labeled as uncooperative at the Dr. J. P. Lord
        School for the Phy sically Handicapped tremble in his wheelchair with fear. As one of them,
        I was scared to death when she came to get me for an unscheduled visit.<br/><br/>
        Then, I was labeled a horrible little boy who wouldn’t do what his therapist told him to do. I seemed rebellious
        because I was so uncoordinated: Even after years of therapy, I still could not walk, talk or use my hands.
        Sometimes I asked myself, Why should I make the effort? As Miss Neff told my parents, “We always try to do what
        we’ve done in other, similar situations, and if that doesn’t work, we look for something new.” But nothing old or new
        was working for me.<br/><br/>
        There I was, at any rate, being pushed by Miss Neff into her office when it wasn’t even time for my therapy. I was
        petrified! What had I done wrong this time? Had they finally given up on me? Was I getting kicked out of school? I felt
        too stuffy.<br/><br/>
        Miss Neff parked me in front of her steel teacher’s desk, then she sat in her armless chair behind it. Instead of
        scolding me, as I had anticipated, she showed me some mimeo graphed diagrams of what looked like a large but poorly
        shaped slingshot that was rounded at the fork. It looked ridiculous to me. Then she showed me another diagram of a
        kid typing with this contraption on his head.<br/><br/>
        During that year’s teachers’ convention, Miss Neff along with the school’s speech therapist, phy sical therapist and
        Mrs. Clanton, my new classroom teacher attended another special school that was in Iowa City. At that school, they
        saw a student using a headstick to type his schoolwork.<br/><br/>
        “This is a headstick,” she said sternly. “It is not a toy or a weapon. We think that you will be able to use it if you
        want to, but it will be very hard work. And if I ever see you using it to poke somebody, I’ll take it away from you
        immediately. Understand?”<br/><br/>
        I nodded stiffly.<br/><br/>
        “Now,” she continued, “at the next PTA meeting, I will give your mother some directions for exercises to
        strengthen your neck. I suggest that you do them at home everyday. I also suggest that you do them in the morning
        when you are fresh. It will be tiresome work, but you just might be able to do it.”<br/><br/>
        After Miss Neff lectured me, Mrs. Clanton who, unlike all my therapists, had not witnessed my many failures said
        simply, “I think you can do it. Do you?”<br/><br/>
        I nodded. My journey from solitary confinement had begun. Everyday I did my neck exercises before going to
        school. After a family friend crafted me a home-made headstick to use, I practiced using it at school to turn the pages
        of a spiral-bound book; to point to words on an elaborate language board made by my speech therapist, and, of course,
        to do those lovely neck exercises. I cannot give you a description of my first real taste of success. It was like a dream.
        Up until this adventure with the headstick, every thing the therapist had tried on me had not worked because I was so
        uncoordinated that I gave up in frustration. But this was different.<br/><br/>
        I full-heartedly believed in her. If she’d said I could fly, I would have jumped off the Empire State Building without
        any reservations and flapped my spindly arms until I splattered on the sidewalk. She was a friend as well as a teacher. I
        still remember how she played baseball with my class to make up for an extremely dull recreation hour when we had
        to sit through an inaudible play. So I worked hard to please her, not minding the very few dis appointments of this
        project.<br/><br/>
        My teacher and therapists thought that I was intelligent because they watched my eyes and facial expressions
        during my lessons. But as Mrs. Clanton told my parents, “We have no way of testing his knowledge of each of his
        subjects.”<br/><br/>
        The climax of this successful adventure came when Miss Neff put me in a straight-backed wooden chair with arms.
        She tied me in because I couldn’t balance on my own. She put the band with a sty lus attached to it on my head. Then
        she pushed me up to an ancient black type writer. I swear that typewriter was used by Thomas Edison.<br/><br/>
        Miss Neff told me to turn the old typewriter on. To our surprise I did quickly! She told me to type my name. I did.
        She told me to type the alphabet. I did! By this time, the speech therapist, the phy sical therapist and Mrs. Clanton had
        been called into the occupational therapy room to share in my victory over silence.<br/><br/>
        The people who were crowded into that stale, window less room thought that my communication had gotten the
        best that it could have gotten. We were so wrong. Throughout the years my ability to communicate has been enriched
        and augmented by the computer age.<br/><br/>
        Although this adventure may be small compared with climbing Mount Everest or sailing the ocean on a raft, it was
        just as important. Through it God enabled me to conquer higher mountains and sail wider seas, now that he had helped
        me break the bounds of silence that held me for eleven years.

        were usually so grateful to be alive or just wanted to die. A quick glance told all.
        Albert taught me much about strokes.<br/><br/>
        One afternoon while making rounds I’d met him, curled in a fetal position. A pale, dried-up old
        man with a look of death, head half-buried under a blanket. He didn’t budge when I introduced myself, and he said
        nothing when I referred to dinner “soon.”<br/><br/>
        At the nurse’s station, an attendant provided some history. He had no one. He’d lived too long. Wife of thirty years
        dead, five sons gone.<br/><br/>
        Well, maybe I could help. A chunky but pretty divorced nurse avoiding the male population outside of work, I
        could satisfy a need. I flirted.<br/><br/>
        The next day I wore a dress, not my usual nursing uniform but white. I came to Albert’s room. No lights on.
        Curtains drawn.<br/><br/>
        Albert hollered at the staff to get out. I pulled a chair close to his bed, crossing my shapely legs, head tilted. I gave
        him a perfect smile.<br/><br/>
        “Leave me. I want to die.”<br/><br/>
        “What a crime, all us single women out there.”<br/><br/>
        He looked annoyed. I rambled on about how I liked working “rehab” unit because I got to watch people reach
        their maximum potential. He said nothing.<br/><br/>
        Two days later during shift report, I learned that Albert had asked when I’d be “on.” The charge nurse referred to
        him as my “boy friend” and word got around. I never argued. Outside his room, I’d tell others not to bother “my
        Albert.”<br/><br/>
        Soon he agreed to “dangle,” sit on the side of the bed to build up sitting tolerance, and balance. He agreed to
        “work” with phy sical therapy if I’d return “to talk.”<br/><br/>
        Two months later, Albert was on a walker. By the third month, he’d progressed to a cane. Fridays we celebrated
        discharges with a barbecue. Albert and I danced to Edith Piaf. He wasn’t graceful, but he was leading. Tear-streaked
        cheeks touched as we bade our good-byes.<br/><br/>
        Periodically roses, mums and sweet peas would turn up. He was gardening again.<br/><br/>
        Then one afternoon, a lovely lavender-clad woman came on the unit demanding “that hussy.”<br/><br/>
        My supervisor called; I was in the middle of giving a bed bath.<br/><br/>
        “So you’re the one! The woman who reminded my Albert that he’s a man!” Her head tilted in full smile as she
        handed me a wedding invitation`,

        contentEn: `Tumbling time!” I called out. My group of giggling children lined up before the sea of blue
        mats. Megan trailed behind and stepped quietly into the back of the line. She was eight
        years old, the same age I was when I began sports acrobatics.<br/><br/>
        I started the class with forward and backward rolls, cart wheels and handstand
        forward rolls. The children had mastered this series months ago. Two girls and a boy had even
        achieved back handsprings on their own. But Megan was still working on handstand forward rolls. It simply took her a
        little longer to learn the tumbling moves.<br/><br/>
        I caught her ankles as she kicked into a handstand. While checking her body alignment, I reminded her to
        straighten her legs, to push against the floor and to tuck in her chin. When she lost her balance, I continued to guide
        her and then we started the process again. Each time she stood up I made a special effort to find something to
        compliment. “What beautiful pointed toes you have,” or “Your legs were much straighter than last time,” or “That was
        the strongest handstand I’ve seen you do yet.”<br/><br/>
        One day before class, Megan’s father asked to talk to me. By his somber expression I didn’t know what to expect.<br/><br/>
        “I’m thinking of taking Megan out of class,” he said.<br/><br/>
        “Why? Had I done something wrong?“ I asked.<br/><br/>
        His arm draped protectively over Megan’s shoulders, he said, “She isn’t catching on like the other kids are. I don’t
        want her to hold them back.”<br/><br/>
        I could see his pained expression as he said this. Megan’s eyes were downcast as if she wanted to disappear.<br/><br/>
        “I think you’re making a mistake,” I said. “Megan needs this class, possibly more than the other children need it. I
        didn’t start out as a seven-time national champion. I started out as an eight-year-old girl, just like Megan. My coach
        Igor used to say, ‘There are children with talent, then there is Christine. She just works hard.’ When I look at Megan I
        see myself. She works hard.”<br/><br/>
        “Sir, your daughter may never win a competition. She may never even compete, but I promise you that if she
        keeps trying and believing in herself, her self-esteem will be more important than any gold medal ever won. I believe
        in Megan. I believe that she can accomplish any thing she sets out to do, in her own time.”
        As I said these words Megan looked up at me. Her eyes were filled with tears, and she was smiling like a bud
        flowering into bloom.<br/><br/>
        Her father hugged me and whispered, “Thank you. Thank you so much.” He turned to Megan and said, “Honey, go
        and put on your leotard. It’s time for your class.”<br/><br/>
        Megan eventually did learn handstand forward rolls as well as many other skills in her own time. More
        importantly, she never again stood at the back of the line. From that day forward, whenever I asked the children to
        line up for tumbling, Megan ran to stand in the front.

        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `When people find out that I competed in the Olympics, they assume I’ve always been an
        accomplished athlete. But it isn’t true. I was not the strongest, or the fastest, and I
        didn’t learn the quickest. For me, becoming an Olympian was not developing a gift of
        natural athletic ability, but was, literally, an act of will.<br/><br/>
        At the 197 2 Olympics in Munich, I was a member of the U.S. pentathlon team, but the tragedy
        of the Israeli athletes and an injury to my ankle combined to make the experience a deeply discouraging one. I didn’t
        quit; instead I kept training, eventually qualifying to go with the U.S. team to Montreal for the 197 6 Games. The
        experience was much more joyous, and I was thrilled to place thirteenth. But still, I felt I could do better.<br/><br/>
        I arranged to take a leave of absence from my college coaching job the year before the 1980 Olympics. I figured
        that twelve months of “twenty-four-hour-a-day training” would give me the edge I needed to bring home a medal this
        time. In the summer of 197 9, I started intensively training for the Olympic trials to be held in June of 1980. I felt the
        exhilaration that comes with single-minded focus and steady progress towards a cherished goal.<br/><br/>
        But then in November, what appeared to be an insurmountable obstacle occurred. I was in a car accident and
        injured my lower back. The doctors weren’t sure exactly what was wrong, but I had to stop training because I couldn’t
        move without experiencing excruciating pain. It seemed all too obvious that I would have to give up my dream of
        going to the Olympics if I couldn’t keep training. Everyone felt so sorry for me. Everyone but me.<br/><br/>
        It was strange, but I never believed this setback would stop me. I trusted that the doctors and phy sical therapists
        would get it handled soon, and I would get back to training. I held on to the affirmation: I’m getting better everyday
        and I will place in the top three at the Olympic trials. It went through my head constantly.<br/><br/>
        But my progress was slow, and the doctors couldn’t agree on a course of treatment. Time was passing, and I was
        still in pain, unable to move. With only a few months remaining, I had to do something or I knew I would never make
        it. So I started training the only way I could in my head.<br/><br/>
        A pentathlon consists of five track and field events: the 100-meter hurdle, the shot put, the high jump, the long
        jump and the 200-meter sprint. I obtained films of the world-record holders in all five of my events and watched the
        films over and over. Sometimes, I watched them in slow motion or frame by frame. When I got bored, I watched them
        backwards, just for fun. I watched for hundreds of hours, studying and absorbing. Other times, I lay on the couch and
        visualized the experience of competing in minute detail. I know some people thought I was crazy, but I wasn’t ready to
        give up yet. I trained as hard as I could without ever moving a muscle.<br/><br/>
        Finally, the doctors diagnosed my problem as a bulging disc. Now I knew why I was in agony when I moved, but I
        still couldn’t train. Later, when I could walk a little, I went to the track and had them set up all five of my events. Even
        though I couldn’t practice, I would stand on the track and envision in my mind the complete phy sical training routine
        I would have gone through that day if I had been able. For months, I repeatedly imagined myself competing and
        qualifying at the trials.<br/><br/>
        But was visualizing enough? Was it truly possible that I could place in the top three at the Olympic trials? I
        believed it with all my heart.<br/><br/>
        By the time the trials actually rolled around, I had healed just enough to compete. Being very careful to keep my
        muscles and tendons warm, I moved through my five events as if in a dream. Afterwards, as I walked across the field, I
        heard a voice on the loudspeaker announcing my name.<br/><br/>
        It took my breath away, even though I had imagined it a thousand times in my mind. I felt a wave of pure joy wash
        over me as the announcer said, “Second place, 1980 Olympic Pentathlon: Marilyn King.”`,

        profession reserves for severe illness. “Eventually, you may lose your eyesight, even
        your bladder control.”<br/><br/>
        The words hit my wife and I squarely. I was twenty-seven and had multiple
        sclerosis. I wanted to come to grips with this news, but right now all I could think of was ending
        this office visit. This doctor offered no hope and he was scaring my wife and me in the process. I stole a glance at Tracy,
        who began to cry softly. I reached over to comfort her, my soul mate. We mumbled hurried good byes and left.<br/><br/>
        I was in the construction business along with my dad, who owned the company. We raised buildings from the
        ground up and it was hard, demanding labor filled with long hours. But I loved it. I had walked the slender steel beams
        since the tender age of fourteen and probably felt more at home on a construction site than anywhere else. My dad
        taught me the ropes.<br/><br/>
        I couldn’t bear the thought of letting him down now.<br/><br/>
        After I dropped Tracy off at home, I mentioned that I had to stop by the office for something. But actually, I
        wanted to pay a visit to a place that I had known for a very long time.<br/><br/>
        I sat in the church pew, feeling childhood memories wash over me. My eyes were squeezed shut as I anxiously
        prayed. “Dear Lord,” I said. “I’m not afraid for myself, but I am afraid that I will let my wife and family down they
        count on me for so much. Please, please help me beat this,” I whispered.<br/><br/>
        I got up, left the church and hoped that my prayers would be answered. If ever there was a time to keep my faith
        up, it was now.<br/><br/>
        A few weeks later, the local paper featured an article in the sports section on a man named Pat. It was like a little
        miracle had come my way. Pat was a coach at the state college, and had conquered MS with the help of a strict diet.
        At last I had found an ally, someone with the same symptoms, and likely the same doubts and fears. Pat and I met
        and talked for hours about food supplements, vitamins and working out. But these eight words echoed in my brain:
        “You can do it, Jason. Never give up.”<br/><br/>
        I started a special diet and workout regime designed for MS patients, and stuck faithfully to it.<br/><br/>
        There were plenty of dark days, too. Days when I had to ask Tracy to help me finish dressing. Through all of this,
        she was spectacular, giving me the love and sup port I needed. I felt so blessed. Gradually, my recovery took shape. In
        time, the words of the doctor seemed far away.<br/><br/>
        Finally, I felt ready to set a goal for myself.<br/><br/>
        The challenge came in the form of natural bodybuilding. I had played football in high school and college, and I was
        certainly no stranger to the weight room. I began working out diligently with a trainer six days a week. He put me
        through different weight routines. My goal was to compete in a bodybuilding contest.<br/><br/>
        A few months later, all the hours of sweat and training brought me to a competition that included one threeminute routine. I found myself in front of an auditorium filled with people.<br/><br/>
        I completed my routine flexing, stretching, showing off the body I had fought so hard to achieve and walked off.
        As I waited for the judges to tally my score, I spotted my family and friends in the fourth row. When the judges
        announced that I had placed sixth, I felt a rush of pride and relief. As I took a bow, I stole a quick glance at my family,
        who were all standing up and clapping and cheering as hard as they could.<br/><br/>
        Before we left to celebrate at a nearby restaurant, my dad came over and put both his hands on my shoulders.<br/><br/>
        “Jason, I’m so proud of you. As far as I’m concerned, you are number one!” he said.<br/><br/>
        He looked me right in the eyes. “We build foundations in our business, but let me tell you, the real foundations in
        life are family.”<br/><br/>
        I hugged my dad tightly then, and as I did, I saw Tracy give me the thumbs-up sign and dazzle me with a smile as
        big as all outdoors.<br/><br/>
        Today, Tracy and I are the proud parents of two little girls. They are more precious than we could have ever
        imagined. And everyday I remember my father’s words:<br/><br/>
        “The real foundations in life are family.”`,

        languished in debtors’ jail, painful pangs of hunger gnawed at his stomach. To feed himself,
        the boy took a job pasting labels on blacking bottles in a grim, rat-infested warehouse. He
        slept in a dismal attic room with two other street urchins, while secretly dreaming of
        becoming a writer. With only four years of schooling, he had little confidence in his ability.

        author: `Ruchoma Sham`,
        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `One hot summer day, a young couple and their four-year-old daughter, Tzippie, were on their
        way to the mountains for a few weeks’ vacation. Suddenly, a huge truck in the oncoming lane
        collided head-on with the family’s small car. The couple was injured seriously, and little
        Tzippie sustained many fractures. They were immediately taken to the nearest hospital,
        where Tzippie was brought to the children’s ward and her parents were taken to the
        intensive care unit. As can well be imagined, Tzippie was not only in great pain, but she was also very
        frightened because her parents were not nearby to give her comfort.<br/><br/>
        Martha, the nurse who was assigned to Tzippie, was a single, older woman. She understood Tzippie’s fear and
        insecurity and became very devoted to her. When Martha finished her shift, instead of going home, she would
        volunteer to stay with Tzippie at night. Of course, Tzippie grew very fond of her and depended on her for her every
        need. Martha brought her cookies, picture books and toys; she sang songs to her and told her countless stories.<br/><br/>
        When Tzippie was able to be moved, Martha put her in a wheelchair and took her to visit her parents everyday.<br/><br/>
        After many months of hospitalization, the family was dis charged. Before they left the hospital, the parents blessed
        Martha for her devoted and loving care and invited her to visit them. Tzippie would not let go of Martha, and insisted
        that she come to live with them. Martha also did not want to be parted from her little Tzippie, but her life was in the
        children’s ward of the hospital, and she could not think of leaving. There was a tearful parting as Tzippie and the loving
        nurse said good-by e to each other. For a few months the family kept up a close relationship with Martha through
        phone calls only, since they lived quite a distance from her. When they moved abroad, however, they lost contact with
        each other.<br/><br/>
        Over thirty years passed. One winter Martha, who was now in her seventies, became seriously ill with pneumonia
        and was hospitalized in the geriatric ward of a hospital near her home. There was a certain nurse on duty who noticed
        that Martha had very few visitors. She tried her best to give the elderly lady special care, and she saw that she was a
        sensitive, clever person.<br/><br/>
        One night when the nurse was sitting near her elderly patient and they were chatting quietly, she confided in her
        as to what had prompted her to become a nurse. When she was four years old, she explained, and her parents had been
        injured in an automobile accident, there had been a wonderful nurse who had brought her back to health with her
        loving, caring devotion. As she grew older, she determined that one dayshe, too, would become a nurse and help
        others from the young to the old just as that nurse had done for her.<br/><br/>
        After she graduated from nursing school overseas, she had met a young man from America, and when they
        married, they moved to the States. A few months earlier they had moved to this city, where her husband had been
        offered a very good job, and she was happy to get a position as a nurse in this hospital. As the nurse’s story unfolded,
        tears flowed from the elderly patient’s eyes, as she realized that this must surely be her little Tzippie, whom she had
        cared for after the accident.<br/><br/>
        When the young nurse had finished her story, Martha said softly, “Tzippie, we are together again, but this time you
        are nursing me!” Tzippie’s eyes opened wide as she stared at Martha, suddenly recognizing her. “Is it really you?” she
        cried out. “How many times I have thought about you and prayed that someday we would meet again!”<br/><br/>
        When Martha recovered from her illness, Tzippie this time did not beg her to come and live with her family.<br/><br/>
        Instead, she just packed up Martha’s belongings and took her home with her. She lives with Tzippie to this day, and
        Tzippie’s husband and children have welcomed her like a most special grandmother.`,

        author: `Arthur Gordon
        Submitted by Wayne W. Hinckley`,
        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `Not long ago, I came to one of those bleak periods that many of us encounter from time to
        time, a sudden drastic dip in the graph of living when every thing goes stale and flat, energy
        wanes, enthusiasm dies. The effect on my work was frightening. Every morning I clenched
        my teeth and muttered: “Today life will take on some of its old meaning. You’ve got to break
        through this thing. You’ve got to.”<br/><br/>
        But the barren days dragged on, and the paralysis grew worse. The time came when I knew I needed help.<br/><br/>
        The man I turned to was a doctor. Not a psy chiatrist, just a doctor. He was older than I, and under his surface
        gruffness lay great wisdom and experience. “I don’t know what’s wrong,” I told him miserably, “but I just seem to have
        come to a dead end. Can you help me?”<br/><br/>
        “I don’t know,” he said slowly. He made a tent of his fingers, and gazed at me thoughtfully for a long while. Then,
        abruptly, he asked, “Where were you happiest as a child?”<br/><br/>
        “As a child?” I echoed. “Why, at the beach, I suppose. We had a summer cottage there. We all loved it.”<br/><br/>
        He looked out the window and watched the October leaves sifting down. “Are you capable of following
        instructions for a single day?”<br/><br/>
        “I think so,” I said, ready to try any thing.<br/><br/>
        “All right. Here’s what I want you to do.”<br/><br/>
        He told me to drive to the beach alone the following morning, arriving not later than nine o’clock. I could take
        some lunch, but I was not to read, write, listen to the radio or talk to anyone. “In addition,” he said, “I’ll give you a
        prescription to be taken every three hours.”<br/><br/>
        He tore off four prescription blanks, wrote a few words on each, folded them, numbered them and handed them to
        me. Take these at nine, twelve, three and six.<br/><br/>
        “Are you serious?” I asked.<br/><br/>
        He gave me a short honk of laughter. “You won’t think I’m joking when you get my bill!”<br/><br/>
        The next morning, with little faith, I drove to the beach. It was lonely, all right. A northeaster was blowing; the sea
        looked gray and angry. I sat in the car, the whole daystretching emptily before me. Then I took out the first of the
        folded slips of paper. On it was written: “Listen carefully.”<br/><br/>
        I stared at the two words. Why, I thought, the man must be mad. He had ruled out music and newscasts and
        human conversation. What else was there?<br/><br/>
        I raised my head and listened. There were no sounds but the steady roar of the sea, the croaking cry of a gull, the
        drone of some aircraft, overhead. All these sounds were familiar.<br/><br/>
        I got out of the car. A gust of wind slammed the door with a sudden clap of sound. Was I supposed, I asked myself,
        to listen carefully to things like that?<br/><br/>
        I climbed a dune and looked out over the deserted beach. Here the sea bellowed so loudly that all other sounds
        were lost. And yet, I thought suddenly, there must be sounds beneath sounds the soft rasp of drifting sand, the tiny
        wind-whisperings in the dune grasses if the listener got close enough to hear them.<br/><br/>
        Impulsively, I ducked down and, feeling fairly ridiculous, thrust my head into a clump of seaweed. Here I made a
        discovery : If you listen intently, there is a fractional moment in which every thing pauses, waiting. In that instant of
        stillness, the racing thoughts halt. The mind rests?<br/><br/>
        I went back to the car and slid behind the wheel. Listen carefully. As I listened again to the deep growl of the sea, I
        found myself thinking about the white-fanged fury of its storms. Then I realized I was thinking of things bigger than
        myself and there was relief in that.<br/><br/>
        Even so, the morning passed slowly. The habit of hurling myself at a problem was so strong that I felt lost without
        it.<br/><br/>
        By noon the wind had swept the clouds out of the sky, and the sea had a polished and merry sparkle. I unfolded the
        second “prescription.” And again I sat there, half-amused and half-exasperated. Three words this time: “Try reaching
        back.”<br/><br/>
        Back to what? To the past, obviously. But why, when all my worries concerned the present or the future?
        I left the car and started tramping reflectively along the dunes. The doctor had sent me to the beach because it
        was a place of happy memories. Maybe that was what I was supposed to reach for the happiness that lay half-forgotten
        behind me.<br/><br/>
        I decided to work on these vague impressions as a painter would, retouching the colors, strengthening the
        outlines. I would choose specific incidents and recapture as many details as possible. I would visualize people
        complete with dress and gesfures. I would listen (carefully ) for the exact sound of their voices, the echo of their
        laughter.<br/><br/>
        The tide was going out now, but there was still thunder in the surf. So I chose to go back twenty years to the last
        fishing trip I made with my younger brother. He had died during World War II, but I found that if I closed my eyes and
        really tried, I could see him with amazing vividness, even the humor and eagerness in his eyes.<br/><br/>
        In fact, I saw it all: the ivory scimitar of beach where we fished, the eastern sky smeared with sunrise, the great
        rollers creaming in, stately and slow. I felt the backwash swirl warm around my knees, saw the sudden arc of my
        brother’s rod as he struck a fish, heard his exultant yell. Piece by piece I rebuilt it, clear and unchanged under the
        transparent varnish of time. Then it was gone.<br/><br/>
        I sat up slowly. Try reaching back. Happy people were usually assured, confident people. If, then, you
        deliberately reached back and touched happiness, might there not be released little flashes of power, tiny sources of
        strength?<br/><br/>
        This second period of the day went more quickly. As the sun began its long slant down the sky, my mind ranged
        eagerly through the past, reliving some episodes, uncovering others that had been completely forgotten. Across all
        the years, I remembered events, and knew from the sudden glow of warmth that no kindness is ever wasted, or ever
        completely lost.<br/><br/>
        By three o’clock the tide was out and the sound of the waves was only a rhy thmic whisper, like a giant breathing. I
        stayed in my sandy nest, feeling relaxed and con tent and a little complacent. The doctor’s prescriptions, I thought,
        were easy to take.<br/><br/>
        But I was not prepared for the next one. This time the three words were not a gentle suggestion. They sounded
        more like a command. “Reexamine your motives.”<br/><br/>
        To those words my first reaction was purely defensive. There’s nothing wrong with my motives, I said to myself. I
        want to be successful who doesn’t? I want to have a certain amount of recognition, but so does everybody. I want
        more security than I’ve got and why not?<br/><br/>
        Maybe, said a small voice somewhere inside my head, those motives aren’t good enough. Maybe that’s the reason
        the wheels have stopped going around.<br/><br/>
        I picked up a handful of sand and let it stream between my fingers. In the past, whenever my work went well, there
        had always been something spontaneous about it, something uncontrived, something free. Lately it had been
        calculated, competent and dead. Why? Because I had been looking past the job itself to the rewards I hoped it would
        bring. The work had ceased to be an end in itself; it had become a means to make money, pay bills. The sense of giving
        something, of helping people, of making a contribution, had been lost in a frantic clutch of security.<br/><br/>
        In a flash of certainty, I saw that if one’s motives are wrong, nothing can be right. It makes no difference whether
        you are a mailman, a hairdresser, an insurance salesman, a stay -at-home mom or dad whatever. As long as you feel
        you are serving others, you do the job well. When you are concerned only with helping yourself, you do it less well.<br/><br/>
        This is a law as inexorable as gravity.<br/><br/>
        For a long time, I sat there. Far out on the bar I heard the murmur of the surf change to a hollow roar as the tide
        turned. Behind me the spears of light were almost horizontal. My time at the beach had almost run out, and I felt a
        grudging admiration for the doctor and the “prescriptions” he had so casually and cunningly devised. I saw, now, that
        in them was a therapeutic progression that might well be valuable to anyone facing any difficulty.<br/><br/>
        Listen carefully : To calm a frantic mind, slow it down, shift the focus from inner problems to outer things.<br/><br/>
        Try reaching back: Since the human mind can hold but one idea at a time, you blot out present worry when you
        touch the happiness of the past.<br/><br/>
        Reexamine your motives: This was the hard core of the “treatment.” This challenge was to reappraise, to bring
        one’s motives into alignment with one’s capabilities and conscience. But the mind must be clear and receptive to do
        this.<br/><br/>
        The western sky was a blaze of crimson as I took out the last slip of paper. Six words this time. I walked slowly out
        on the beach. A few yards below the high-water mark I stopped and read the words again: “Write your troubles on the
        sand.”<br/><br/>
        I let the paper blow away, reached down and picked up a fragment of shell. Kneeling there under the vault of the
        sky, I wrote several words on the sand, one above the other. Then I walked away, and I did not look back. I had written
        my troubles on the sand. And the tide was coming in`,

        contentEn: `My brother-in-law opened the bottom drawer of my sister’s bureau and lifted out a tissuewrapped package.
        “This,” he said, “is a slip.”<br/><br/>
        He discarded the tissue and handed me the slip. It was exquisite: silk, handmade and trimmed
        with a cobweb of lace. The price tag with an astronomical figure on it was still attached.<br/><br/>
        “Jan bought this the first time we went to New Y ork, at least eight or nine years ago. She never wore it. She was
        saving it for a special occasion. Well, I guess this is the occasion.”<br/><br/>
        He took the slip from me, and put it on the bed with the other clothes we were taking to the mortician. His hands
        lingered on the soft material for a moment, then he slammed the drawer shut and turned to me.<br/><br/>
        “Don’t ever save any thing for a special occasion. Everyday you’re alive is a special occasion.”<br/><br/>
        I remembered those words through the funeral and the days that followed, when I helped him and my niece
        attend to all the sad chores that result from an unexpected death. I thought about them on the plane returning to
        California after my sister’s funeral. I thought about all the things that she hadn’t seen or heard or done. I thought about
        the things that she had done without realizing that they were special.<br/><br/>
        I’m still thinking about his words, and they ’ve changed my life. I’m reading more and dusting less. I’m sitting on
        the deck and admiring the view without fussing about the weeds in the garden. I’m spending more time with my family
        and friends and less time in committee meetings. Whenever possible, life should be a pattern of experiences to savor,
        not endure. I’m trying to recognize these moments now and cherish them.<br/><br/>
        I’m not “saving” any thing: We use our good china and cry stal for every special event such as losing a pound,
        getting the sink unstopped, the first camellia blossom.<br/><br/>
        I wear my good blazer to the market if I feel like it. My theory is if I look prosperous, I can shell out $28.49 for one
        small bag of groceries without wincing. I’m not saving my good perfume for special parties: Clerks in hardware stores
        and tellers in banks have noses that function as well as my party-going friends.<br/><br/>
        “Someday ” and “one of these days” are losing their grip on my vocabulary. If it’s worth seeing or hearing or doing,
        I want to see and hear and do it now.<br/><br/>
        I’m not sure what my sister would have done had she known that she wouldn’t be here for the tomorrow we all
        take for granted. I think she would have called family members and a few close friends. She might have called a few
        former friends to apologize and mend fences for past squabbles. I like to think she would have gone out for a Chinese
        dinner. I’m guessing; I’ll never know.<br/><br/>
        It’s those little things left undone that would make me angry if I knew that my hours were limited. Angry because I
        put off seeing good friends whom I was going to get in touch with someday. Angry because I hadn’t written certain
        letters that I intended to write one of these days. Angry and sorry that I didn’t tell my husband and daughter often
        enough how much I truly love them. I’m trying very hard not to put off, hold back or save any thing that would add
        laughter and luster to our lives.<br/><br/>
        And every morning when I open my eyes, I tell myself that it is special. Everyday, every minute, every breath
        truly is a gift from God`,

        contentEn: `How old are you?” a stranger asked my daughter, Melissa, at a party six years ago.<br/><br/>
        “Two,” she answered.<br/><br/>
        “And are you married?” the woman teased.<br/><br/>
        “No!” Melissa answered, smiling. Then she dropped her smile, and in a serious tone added, “But my mommy was,
        and my daddy was.”<br/><br/>
        I eavesdropped from a safe distance, wondering what might follow. Would Melissa, with her advanced vocabulary,
        tell this stranger that her parents were divorced? Even worse, would my toddler act out and hit the woman, or start
        crying?<br/><br/>
        To my surprise, with glee, Melissa added, “My mommy was married to my daddy.” She then toddled off.<br/><br/>
        Twenty months earlier, when Melissa was six months old, my husband discarded me like a well-worn pair of shoes
        and replaced me with his high-school crush. No explanation. Just a silent, seeping withdrawal that culminated in an
        abrupt exit from what had seemed on the surface a happy marriage.<br/><br/>
        As I’d wake at dawn to Melissa’s cries, I’d find myself curled up in a corner of the huge mattress, clutching what for
        six years had been someone else’s pillow. I’d drag myself out of bed, throw on some sweatpants then feed and dress my
        baby.<br/><br/>
        Just before driving Melissa to day care and burying my grief in my work for eight hours, I’d dab on some make up
        in a feeble attempt to cover the bags under my eyes. Somehow, I had to find a switch that got me through the day.<br/><br/>
        But by nighttime, after I’d tucked her into the crib in a bedroom filled with rainbows and sunshine, I’d crawl next
        door to my lifeless room and cling to the phone, calling everyone I knew just to keep from feeling so alone.<br/><br/>
        One long day evolved into two, then two into three, and slowly, through the haze, I recognized that even though
        my marriage had died, I was still alive. Eventually, I propelled myself out the door and joined a divorce sup port
        group, a new-mother’s network, a local social club and, eventually, dating services.<br/><br/>
        Meanwhile, Melissa grew from a crawler to a walker to a toddler to a talker. Despite knowing life with her parents
        as a series of good-byes and hellos, she was emerging as a precocious, happy, well-adjusted little girl.<br/><br/>
        These traits may have been planted in her genes, or they may have derived from the one-on-one attention she
        received from each parent.<br/><br/>
        From early on, my daughter had an extensive vocabulary and uncanny perception. When she was twenty-two
        months old, she saw me and her father arguing and babbled, with finger pointing: “Don’t be so angry so much, be
        happy.” At two, she heard me complain about something and told me “not to worry.”<br/><br/>
        Yet I did. I worried about competing for her affections with the woman in her father’s life. I worried about
        whether I could ever provide us with a loving man and stepfather so she could learn about love and commitment
        differently than her father and I had taught her. I worried she’d forever be an only child, or, worse, that one dayshe’d
        have step- or, horrors, half-siblings who would be the children of the woman my husband had turned to when he left
        me.<br/><br/>
        Could I stand the emotional pain? Could I nurture my daughter in a healthy way that would teach her that not all
        relationships end in suffering? Could I back off enough to permit her acceptance of her father’s new life, when it tore
        me apart?<br/><br/>
        I tried. I met new people who made my life fuller. I rebuilt my interest in my public-relations business and started
        making and selling jewelry as both a means to keep busy and a way to recover myself-esteem. I learned to enjoy my
        days off and took time with my daughter.<br/><br/>
        With my head clearer and my body thinner from my workouts, I began dating.<br/><br/>
        After my first luscious kiss, I felt I’d experienced life after death!<br/><br/>
        Today, eight years after my ex-husband left, I’m working hard to provide Melissa with a life she deserves. I help
        her tackle her personal goals, like writing in cursive, reading books and learning to ski, and we talk about things that
        matter to her, like friendships, art and animals. My heart swells with pride whenever I meet with one of her teachers,
        because their reports consistently paint a picture of a well-liked child demonstrating healthy self-esteem, intelligence
        and creativity. Just last week her third-grade teacher described Melissa as a child who is always so pleasant, she would
        “make lemonade if life handed her lemons.” Well, life did, and she did!<br/><br/>
        As for myself, I’m doing well and have remarried. I chose a man who didn’t make my heart throb at first, but who
        provided me with the stability I desperately desired. In time, the respect, devotion, love and attraction that has grown
        between us is far more solid than love sparked mainly by lust! I’m grateful not only for my new union, but for my
        daughter’s delight over having a loving step father and an older step-sister whom she adores.<br/><br/>
        Nonetheless, divorce is always with us. Several times each week Melissa goes off to her father’s house where he
        lives with his new wife fortunately not the woman he left me for. Shortly after he “dumped” her a few years ago, I
        panicked over whom he would choose next to be in my daughter’s life; so I introduced him to a woman I hardly knew
        but liked, and she is now his wife! When Melissa spends time with them, I consciously remind myself I’m only
        temporarily “losing” her, that she’ll be back, that it’s quite different from losing a husband and a marriage for ever.
        More important, I’ve learned from my daughter that these are my concerns, and she is still doing fine.<br/><br/>
        Two years ago at age six, when an audiotape of The Little Mermaid ended, Melissa applauded Ariel and Prince
        Eric’s wedding. But one second later, she removed her head phones and banged them against our coffee table.<br/><br/>
        “Please don’t do that,” I calmly but firmly said. “Do you think you struck the table because you were feeling angry
        that Ariel and Prince Eric are married, yet your parents aren’t any more?” I asked, as though straight from the
        parenting manual on drawing out a child’s feelings.<br/><br/>
        “No, Mommy,” she promptly and assertively replied, looking at me as though I’d just called an apple an orange.<br/><br/>
        “These headphones have been hurting my ears. Sorry.” She then calmly continued with her next activity.<br/><br/>
        That day I finally learned my lesson: “Lighten up, Mom! There’s life after divorce!” There are many wondrous new
        things in this little girl’s world and in mine. She’ll be okay. We’ll all be okay. Don’t worry so much; be happy`,

        contentEn: `I was in high school before I realized my father had a birth defect. He had a harelip and cleft
        palate, but to me he looked like he had always looked since the day I was born. I can remember
        kissing him goodnight once when I was young and asking if my nose would go flat after a life time
        of kisses. He assured me that it would not, but I remember a twinkle in his eyes. I am sure he was
        marveling about a daughter who loved him so much she thought that her kisses, not thirty-three
        operations, had reshaped his face.<br/><br/>
        My father was kind, patient, thoughtful and loving. He was my hero and first love. He never met a person in whom
        he could not find good. He knew the first names of janitors, secretaries and CEOs. In truth, I think he liked the janitors
        the best. He always inquired about their families and how life was treating them. He cared enough to listen to their
        responses and remember their answers.<br/><br/>
        Dad never let his disfigurement rule his life. When he was considered too unattractive for sales work, he took a
        bike out on deliveries and created his own route. When the army wouldn’t let him enlist, he volunteered. He even once
        asked a Miss America contestant out for a date. “If you don’t ask you’ll never know,” he told me later. He rarely talked
        on the phone, because people had a hard time understanding him. When they met him in person with his positive
        attitude and friendly smile, people just seemed to take his disability in stride. He married a beautiful woman, and they
        had seven healthy children, all of whom thought the sun and moon rose in his face.<br/><br/>
        When I was a “sophisticated teen,” however, I barely tolerated being in the same room with this same man who for
        a decade had let me watching him shave every morning.<br/><br/>
        My friends were chic, trendy and popular; my dad was old and outdated. One night I came home with a car full of
        friends, and we stopped at my house for midnight snacks. My father came out of his bedroom and welcomed my
        friends, pouring sodas and making popcorn. One of my friends pulled me aside and asked, “What’s wrong with your
        dad?”<br/><br/>
        Suddenly, I saw him for the first time with unbiased eyes. I was in shock. My dad was a freak! I made everyone
        leave immediately. I felt so foolish. How could I have never seen it before?<br/><br/>
        Later that night I cried, not because I realized that my dad was different, but because I realized what a pathetic,
        shallow person I was becoming. Here was the sweetest, most loving person you could ask for, and I had judged him on
        his looks.<br/><br/>
        That night I learned that when you love someone totally and then see them through the eyes of ignorance, fear or
        contempt, you begin to understand the profound depths of prejudice. I had seen my dad as strangers did, as someone
        different, deformed and not normal. Not remembering that he was a good person who loved his wife, his children and
        his fellow human beings. He had joys and sorrows and had already lived a lifetime of people judging him on his
        appearance. I was grateful that I got to know him first, before others showed me his flaws.<br/><br/>
        Dad is gone now. Empathy, compassion and concern for fellow human beings are the legacy he left me. They are
        the greatest gifts a parent could leave a child the capacity to love others without considering their social stature, race,
        religion or disabilities, the gifts of joy ful per severance and optimism. The lofty goal of being so loving in my life that I
        receive enough kisses to make my nose go flat`,

        name: `Playing for keeps: Michael Jordan and the world he made`,
        title: ``,
        author: `David Halberstam`,
        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `In the past, America’s ideal of beauty had always been an essentially white one; American males had
        looked longingly in the mirror hoping to see Cary Grant or Gregory Peck or Robert Redford. Michael
        Jordan, shaved head and all, had given America nothing less than a new definition of beauty for a
        new age.<br/><br/>
        What America and the rest of the world saw now was noth ing less than a kind of New World seigneur, a young man
        whose manner seemed nothing less than princely. He was most assuredly not to the manner born - his paternal
        grandfather had been a tobacco sharecropper in North Carolina. His parents were simple and hardworking people, the
        first in their families to enjoy full rights of American citizenship, and they produced a young man who carried himself
        with remarkable natural grace. Because of the loving way he had been raised and because of the endless series of
        triumphs he had scored over the years, he had an inner confidence that was simply unshakable.<br/><br/>
        His manner with all kinds of people in even the briefest of meetings was usually graceful, particularly for someone
        subjected to so many pressures, and those who needed sympathies. He had charm, was very much aware of it, and
        used it skillfully and naturally, rationing it out in just the proper doses. He was easy to like, and people seemed to vie
        to be liked by him. Veteran sportswriter Mark Heisler once noted in a maga zine article that he had never wanted an
        athlete to like him as much as he did Michael Jordan.<br/><br/>
        Each year he seemed to add a new chapter to the legend in the making. Probably the most remarkable chapter had
        been written in June, when he woke up violently ill before Gime Five of the NBA (National Basketball Association)
        finals against the Utah Jazz. Whether it was altitude sickness or food poisoning, no one was ever sure. Later it was
        reported that he had woken up with a fever of 103. That was not true: his temperature was high, but not that high, not
        over 100, but he had been so ill during the night that it seemed impossible that he would play.<br/><br/>
        At about 8 A.M., Jordan’s bodyguards called Chip Schaefer, the team trainer, to tell him that Jordan was deathly
        ill. Schaefer rushed to Jordan’s room and found him curled up in a fetal position, wrapped in blankets and pathetically
        weak. He had not slept at all. He had an intense headache, and had suffered violent nausea throughout the night. The
        greatest player in the world looked like a frail, weak zombie. It was inconceivable that he might play that day.<br/><br/>
        Schaefer immediately hooked him onto an IV and tried to get as much fluid into him as possible. Schaefer also
        gave him some medication so he could rest that morning. More than most people, Schaefer understood the ferocity
        that drove Michael Jordan, the invincible spirit that allowed him to play in games when most high-level professionals
        were betrayed by their bodies and, however reluctantly, obeyed them. During the 1991 finals against the Lakers, when
        Jordan badly injured his toe while hitting a crucial jump shot to tie the game, Schaefer had struggled to create a shoe
        that would protect Jordan’s foot in the next game. Jordan eventually had to reject the shoe because it hindered his
        ability to start and stop and cut. “Give me the pain,” he had told Schaefer.<br/><br/>
        Now, seeing him that sick, Schaefer had a sense that Jordan might somehow manage to play, that Michael Jordan
        might, as he sometimes did in situa tions like this, use this illness as a motivational tool, one more challenge to
        overcome. Before the game, he was still frail and weak. Word circulated quickly among journalists that he had the flu
        and that his temperature was 102, and many assumed he would not play.<br/><br/>
        One member of the media who was not so sure about that verdict was James Worthy of the Fox network. He had
        played with Michael Jordan at North Carolina and watched him emerge as the best player in the NBA, and he knew how
        Michael drove himself. “The fever meant nothing,” Worthy told the other Fox reporters. “Jordan will play,” Worthy
        warned. “He’ll figure out what he can do, he’ll conserve his strength in other areas, and he’ll have a big game,” Worthy
        added.<br/><br/>
        In the locker room, Jordan’s teammates were appalled by what they saw. Michael’s skin, normally quite dark, was
        an alarming color, somewhere between white and gray, and his eyes, usually so vital, looked dead. As the game was
        about to begin, the NBC television crew showed pictures of a frail and haggard Jordan as he had arrived at the Delta
        Center, barely able to walk, but they showed him trying to practice. It was one of those rare moments of unusual
        intimacy in sports, when the power of television allowed the viewer to see both Jordan’s illness and his determination
        to play nonetheless.<br/><br/>
        This was to be a unique participatory experience: when before had illness and exhaustion showed so clearly on
        the face of such an athlete so early in such a vital game? At first, it appeared that the Jazz would blow the very
        vulnerable Bulls out. At one point early in the second quarter, Utah led 36-20. But the Bulls hung in because Jordan
        managed to play at an exceptionally high level, scoring twentyone points in the first half. At halftime his team was
        down only four points, 53-49. It was hard to understand how Jordan could play at all, much less be the best player on
        the floor. The unfolding drama of the event transcended basketball.<br/><br/>
        He could barely walk off the court at halftime. During the break, he told Phil Jackson not to use him much in the
        second half _ just in spots. Then he came out and played almost the entire second half. He played a weak third quarter,
        scoring only two points, but Utah could not put Chicago away. Late in the fourth quarter, when the camera closed in
        on him as he ran down court after a basket, Jordan looked less like the world’s greatest athlete than the worst runner in
        some small-time marathon, about to finish last on a brutally hot day. But what he looked like and what he was doing on
        the floor when it mattered were two separate things.<br/><br/>
        With forty-six seconds left and Utah leading by a point, Jordan was fouled going to the basket. “Look at the body
        language of Michael Jordan,” the announcer Mary Albert said. “You have the idea that he has difficulty just standing
        up.” He made the first foul shot, tying the score, then missed the second but somehow managed to grab the loose ball.<br/><br/>
        Then, when the Jazz inexplicably left him open, he hit a three pointer with twenty five seconds left, which gave Chicago
        an 88-85 lead and the key to a 90-88 win. He ended up with thirty-eight points, fifteen of them in the last quarter.<br/><br/>
        It had been an indelible performance, an astonishing dis play of spiritual determination; he had done nothing less
        than give a clinic in what set him apart from everyone else in his profession. He was the most gifted player in the
        league, but unlike most supremely gifted players, he had an additional quality rare among superb artists whose chosen
        work comes so easily : he was an overachiever as well`

        contentEn: `My husband of twenty-five years had died only three weeks before, and I was alone running a
        business and worried about keeping house and home together. Everyone remarked how well I
        was doing. I looked composed on the surface and was comforted by the convincing role I was
        playing. But frightening questions arose when I didn’t expect them. Could the business
        support my daughter Lexi and me without Paul helping us run it? Where would we move if I
        had to sell our house? Most frightening of all, I was terrified that if I surrendered to my grief, let myself really feel it, I
        would be sucked downward into a dark, bottomless spiral from which I would never return to sanity. I knew I had to
        do something.<br/><br/>
        Several years earlier Paul and I had been very impressed by a man named Tim Piering. He helped people work
        through their deepest fears by leading them through the very things they were most afraid of. I decided to make an
        appointment with him.<br/><br/>
        That Saturday, I drove to Tim’s office in Sierra Madre, located in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains in
        Southern California. Tim, a tall man with a big heart, asked me questions and listened to me for a while, then asked if
        my husband would want me to grieve for him.<br/><br/>
        “No I can’t imagine that he would. In fact, I think he’d strongly object.”<br/><br/>
        “I’m sure he’d object, and I really think I can help, Diana. I think you can tell me the grief you’re feeling, and I will
        help you lessen it. Would you like to try?”<br/><br/>
        “Yes,” I managed to say. It was as if I wanted to hold onto my hidden grief out of loyalty to Paul although I knew
        he’d want me to do every thing I could to move ahead.<br/><br/>
        “Notice the thoughts going on in your head,” Tim said. “All your fears, your considerations, sound like radio
        voices, don’t they? Of all these thoughts, fear is the most debilitating. Not only does it sap your energy, but it also will
        cost you many great opportunities. Just think of how many times you have held back from doing something because of
        fear. If you are willing, I’m going to give you a quick course in stretching your ability to do any thing you want to do.<br/><br/>
        Basically, what will happen is you will have a completely new image of yourself, and you will see how you can take any
        action regardless of what your mind is saying. Your mind can be screaming but you can go ahead and do things in spite
        of the racket going on in your mind.”<br/><br/>
        Tim drove me in his truck high into the nearby mountains. He pulled onto a shoulder and parked. carrying ropes
        and other equipment from the back of his sports utility vehicle, he led me out onto a bridge that spanned a dry wash
        three hundred feet below. I watched as Tim attached a pulley to the bridge railing and to his body and threaded the
        pulleys with ropes. Suddenly, he climbed over the railing and lowered him-self slowly to the bottom of the canyon.<br/><br/>
        Climbing back up the hill, he called, “Want to try it yourself?”<br/><br/>
        “Not on your life!”<br/><br/>
        Tim went over the side once again, showing me how he could maneuver up and down with the pulley, and how a
        safety rope was in place just in case. It did seem very safe, and I began to feel I could do it, and said I might try it
        someday.<br/><br/>
        With that small crack showing in my armor of fear, Tim wasted no time strapping the gear on me and attaching the
        rope to my rappelling ring. He showed me how to gradually roll the pulley and come to a complete stop during the
        descent. He attached the safety rope to himself, too.<br/><br/>
        “Okay, now just step over the railing.”<br/><br/>
        “Ha! Easy for you to say!”<br/><br/>
        I’ve never, ever felt more terrified. Since childhood I’ve been afraid of heights and had recurring nightmares of
        teetering on a cliff or window ledge. I trembled at the mere thought of standing on the outside of the railing. Very, very
        slowly I eased one leg over the railing, saying, “Oh, my God, I am so scared!”<br/><br/>
        Tim held both of my hands firmly on the railing as I lifted the other leg over, leaning as far toward him as I could
        for protec tion. My heart was pounding and I began to whimper.<br/><br/>
        “Let’s just forget the whole thing! It’s your decision, Diana. You don’t have to do it.”<br/><br/>
        No one was making me do this, I realized. I’d come to Tim for help. I had a hunch that if I could only do this, it
        would make all the difference. Again, I resolved to try.<br/><br/>
        “Okay, I’m going to do it. I’m committed.”<br/><br/>
        “Let go with one hand and hold the rope tightly so you won’t start moving until you’re ready.”<br/><br/>
        I was bleating like a terrified sheep, I was so frightened. But I did what Tim said I let go of the railing with one
        hand. Then came the crucial moment. I released the other hand and there I was, swinging in small arcs over the
        canyon.<br/><br/>
        So far, so good.
        “Now very slowly inch your way down a foot or two.”<br/><br/>
        I did. At that moment, my fear was transformed to excitement. It was easy for me to operate the pulley. I took a
        long time lowering myself to the bottom, relishing the view and my victory over the terrified voice in my head. Tim
        ran down to meet me.<br/><br/>
        “Look what you did, Diana! You did it!”<br/><br/>
        And so I had. If I could do that, I could do any thing! I thought to myself. I felt elated and more powerful than I
        ever had before.<br/><br/>
        Then Tim took me to a firing range and had me fire an automatic revolver repeatedly, another thing I would never
        have dreamed of doing. I realize now that Tim wanted me to feel a different kind of fear than what a woman suddenly
        alone would normally feel. Survival in a phy sical sense _ not an emo tional one. I could feel my life beginning again.<br/><br/>
        “Diana, you’ve stretched your reality of what you thought you could do. This is a benchmark that will allow you to
        rise to new levels of action in spite of fear. Whenever you feel confronted by an action you need to take, you can think
        back to this experience, and whatever challenges you face will seem easy. This one short event committing to the
        action of going of the bridge will propel you years ahead in how you operate in scary situations. Regardless of your
        thoughts, you can do almost any thing just because you com mit to doing it. You’ve opened the door to the possibility
        of achieving all your dreams, Diana.”<br/><br/>
        "In the beginning, you may spend most of your time fighting the negative thoughts. But, as you remember what
        you accomplished here today, keep this thought in mind: The world owes you nothing. You’ve landed on the playing
        field of life. The only question is: will you play?”`

        I hate it when I feel sorry for myself. I’m a strong, self-reliant female _ the equivalent of a lieutenant colonel in the
        U.S. Air Force. I shattered the so-called preconception before most people knew what it was. I’ve raised two dynamic,
        smart children, largely on my own after the breakup of two tough marriages. I’ve put myself through college up to and
        including my doctorate. “I am woman. I am strong. Hear me roar!”. I am one tough broad. Then why am I so
        frightened? Why am I crying? Tears are for sissies. My value sy stem, my identity, my whole worldview is shaking
        under the assault of this terrible revelation; every thing is turned upside down. And I’m really, really scared. How
        much time do I have left? I’ve taken care of myself since I was fourteen years old. I’ve never asked for anyone’s help,
        nor have I ever needed it. Now I need help. But whom do I ask? And how do I ask?<br/><br/>
        Anger, rage and self-pity scalpels of the psyche cut at my core with deep and vicious slashes, like a monster
        turned loose inside me. A jumble of confused and ambivalent feelings rise like bile in my belly _ the beginnings of an
        emotional roller coaster ride gone amok. To calm this emotional holocaust, I revert to the clinician in me. As a way of
        denial, repression, avoidance, I cling to whatever gives me momentary relief from the maelstrom of grief.<br/><br/>
        Infiltrating ductal carcinoma _ a moderately fast-metastasizing cancer. The doctors had been following it for the
        three years since I had first reported a suspicious lump in my right breast. Now it had grown to the size of a golf ball. I
        know because I saw it. I had insisted on watching the surgery when they removed the large, red, ugly mass of deadly
        tissue. But because the cancer had spread through the whole breast, the surgeons told me that they needed to perform
        a modified radical mastectomy. As soon as I recovered from that surgery, they would then have to remove the other
        breast due to its high risk of being cancerous as well. Worse yet, in the three-year period that the doctors had been
        “watch ing” the tumor, it had spread to my bones and left lung.<br/><br/>
        Devastated, feeling betrayed by the medical sy stem and by my body, I enrolled in a breast cancer research study
        conducted by author and phy sician John McDougall. It required me to fol low a vegan diet (pure vegetarian with no
        animal-derived prod ucts). I would have tried any thing to help save my life. The only difficulty here was that I could
        not take chemotherapy or radiation because the challenge was to see if a vegan diet alone could reverse the cancer. I
        talked to my then-husband. He thought I was crazy to think that diet had any thing to do with breast cancer, and he
        believed I had fallen into the hands of a quack. Furthermore, he said he was surprised I would fall for “such garbage.”<br/><br/>
        None of my friends or family knew what to advise. So I decided to set my own course and follow where it led.<br/><br/>
        Around the time of my diagnosis, I saw a sporting event on television called the “lronman Triathlon.” I was
        captivated as I watched these superb young athletes race through a 2.4-mile swim, followed immediately by a 1 12-
        mile bike ride, then a full 26.2-mile marathon. “ I want to do that,” then I remem bered: You’re a cancer patient and
        you’re forty-seven years old - way too old to do such an event. But it wasn’t just nega tive self-talk; it was the voice of
        reason. After all, no woman that old had ever attempted the Ironman. But this idea just wouldn’t go away. With my
        new diet, I could swear I was feeling stronger, more energetic, faster, healthier and, I decided I was going to do it. I
        increased my running and added swimming, biking and even weight lifting to my training.<br/><br/>
        Of course, the doctors thought I was absolutely insane. “You should be resting,” they said. “All that stress on your
        body isn’t good for it _ running marathons (much less endurance swims and 100-mile bike rides) will depress your
        immune sy stem.” That’s when I stopped relying solely on the doctors for advice.<br/><br/>
        Back in those days, before most people had even heard of triathlons, there was little guidance on how to train for
        such grueling endurance races. So I just got out there and swam until I couldn’t lift my arms, biked until I couldn’t
        pedal anymore, ran until I couldn’t run another step and lifted as many pounds as I could without injuring myself. To
        simulate actual racing condi tions, I entered every race I could find. If there were two on the same day, so much the
        better, because that would force me to race when tired, a condition I knew I’d face doing the Ironman. I entered “The
        Run to the Sun,” a 37 -mile run up to the top of Haleakala, a 10,000-foot high mountain on the island of Maui, Hawaii.<br/><br/>
        I remember reaching the twenty six-mile point and looking back down at the ocean far, far below, not believing
        that these two legs had already carried me the equivalent of a full marathon-straight uphill. Then I turned back toward
        the mountaintop, still more than ten miles beyond. My first response was “I don’t have it in me; I just can’t do it.” My
        next thought was, “Listen, Lady, if you think this is rough, just wait until you get in the Ironman!” That’s what kept me
        going. If I quit here, how could I face the Ironman? That technique served me well in the com ing months. And
        competing and winning first-place trophies in my age-group events would help me feel more confident.<br/><br/>
        I found myself getting stronger and developing muscles I never knew I had. I was passing later my cancer
        checkups as well: the small spots in my bones once a source of despair because they indicated cancer were
        disappearing, and the tumor in my lung stayed the same size, allowing me to avoid chemo and radiation, and to stay in
        the dietary study.<br/><br/>
        The only real reminder of the cancer were the two postsurgical, angry red gashes, which left a chest that re
        sembled a prepubescent male’s. Because of all my training, I was having to shower and change clothes several times a
        day, so the reminders of the cancer were constant. I wanted so much to have a normal body again. Enter the plastic
        surgeons, who gave me a fabulous choice: I could now pick my new size. “You want a ‘C’?” they said. “We can do that!”<br/><br/>
        I told them I wouldn’t be greedy _ “Just give me what I had before, a nice, average ‘B’.” They also gave me something
        else I never thought possible: breasts that will never sag.<br/><br/>
        I believe you have to look at the positive side of life, and now, at sixty-eight years old, I can really appreciate this
        benefit.<br/><br/>
        Today, there’s no sign of cancer in my body. I’ve continued my vegan, low-fat diet now for more than twenty
        years, and I have never been healthier or more fit in my life. To date I have raced the Ironman Triathlon six times,
        plus over a hundred shorter triathlons, a total of sixty seven marathons, plus hundreds of shorter road races. In 1999,
        I was named one of the Ten Fittest Women in America by Living Fit magazine. In February 2000, on a Fitness Age test,
        my score was equivalent to a fit thirty-twoyear-old’s. My aerobic capacity score was that of a sixteen-year-old.<br/><br/>
        My bone density has increased throughout my fifties and sixties, which is supposed to be “impossible” since most
        people are told they will lose bone density as part of the “natural” aging process. My blood pressure runs 90/60; my
        cholesterol is under 150; I have 15 percent body fat, and my hemoglobin the test for iron in the blood is at the top of
        the charts.<br/><br/>
        I do not share this information about my phy sical condition to boast (although I admit I’m proud of it), but to
        show what can be accomplished through dedication and discipline.<br/><br/>
        Since I’m a vegan I eat no flesh or dairy products I’m “supposed” to be deficient in protein, calcium and iron.<br/><br/>
        Perhaps I’m an anomaly by most medical standards. And maybe a vegan diet and endurance exercise won’t be a
        magical answer for everyone, but I stand as an example of a lifesty le change that might be worth exploring. And I’m
        not alone. Most people know how Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong also demonstrated the power of racing
        for life after his own battles with cancer.<br/><br/>
        When will this awesome journey end? Will I have to slow down gradually, let go, cut back to walking laps around a
        retirement community? I really can’t say. But I know this: I had cancer and it had spread; I might have folded my
        cards, but I chose life, and I’m going to live as long as I can and run the good race in the remainder of my life. Maybe
        only a few will take the path I’ve chosen, but if shar ing my story helps a few more to step forward and race for life, it
        will have been all the more worthwhile.

        author: `William Wagner`,
        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `For nearly twenty years my life revolved around two things: smoking cigarettes _ and
        trying to quit smoking cigarettes. It was a vicious circle, one I couldn’t break.<br/><br/>
        When I married Cassie ten years ago, I crumpled up my pack of cigarettes and swore I
        was quitting.<br/><br/>
        When we bought our first house eight years ago, I marked that rite of passage by pulverizing my pack of cigarettes
        with my shoe heel.<br/><br/>
        When my son, Cole, was born five years ago, I slam-dunked my cigs into a garbage can.<br/><br/>
        And when my daughter, Olivia, was born three years later, yet another pack of butts bit the dust.<br/><br/>
        I even began working out fanatically _ lifting weights and running five days a week, rain or shine. I lost forty
        pounds and developed a rock-hard phy sique, but I never was able to outrun those cigarettes.<br/><br/>
        Smoking is an insidious habit; it scrambles your brain. Rationally, you know cigarettes are lethal _ but every cell
        in your body screams out for that nicotine. So I kept puffing away, the life slowly and invisibly being sucked right out
        of me.<br/><br/>
        One day the will power I had lacked arrived with brusque force, from a most unexpected place: an unclouded
        corner of my son’s mind.<br/><br/>
        As Cassie was driving Cole home from kindergarten, they passed a cemetery, which prompted the boy to ask:<br/><br/>
        “Mom, what’s under tombstones?”<br/><br/>
        She pondered the question for a few moments, trying to think of a delicate answer. Realizing there was no delicate
        answer, she bluntly said, “Dead people.”<br/><br/>
        “Is that where Dad’s going to be because he smokes?” Cole asked.<br/><br/>
        “I hope not,” Cassie replied.<br/><br/>
        “Dad shouldn’t smoke,” Cole said, his voice rising in anger. He kicked the back of the front seat. “Dad’s stupid for
        smoking. When I’m twenty, he’ll be dead.”<br/><br/>
        Cassie was speechless, stunned by Cole’s intuitiveness. Then, just as quickly as he had exploded, he composed
        himself. “I hope he comes back as a ghost and talks to me,” he said placidly. “Like Obi-Wan Kenobi did to Luke
        Skywalker in Star Wars.”<br/><br/>
        When I arrived home from work that evening, Cassie recounted the story to me. She stared right into my eyes and
        said, “He’s already written you off, Will. He’s figured things out in his mind, come to terms with the fact that you won’t
        be around. And if he can only have you as a ghost, that’s what he’ll take.”<br/><br/>
        Although Cole hadn’t said any thing I didn’t already know, his words delivered so honestly and innocently, as
        only a child can do - distilled every thing into a simple, unavoidable truth. Smoking could only lead to one conclusion,
        and when they placed me under that tombstone, life would have to go on without me. If I couldn’t even fool my own
        five-year-old kid, why was I continuing to try to fool myself?<br/><br/>
        Later that evening, I found Colelying on the couch in the family room watching Monsters, Inc.<br/><br/>
        “Cole,” I softly said. “I’ve been thinking about what you said to Mom today, and I’m going to quit smoking. But I
        need your help. It’s too hard to do alone.”<br/><br/>
        The seconds ticked by as he hatched his plan. His lips were pursed, a sure sign that he was deep in thought. Finally,
        he spoke, “Okay. Here’s what we’ll do: every morning and every night, I’ll tell you not to smoke.”<br/><br/>
        “You’ll do that?” I asked.<br/><br/>
        “Yes.”<br/><br/>
        “Promise?”<br/><br/>
        “Yes.”<br/><br/>
        “Sounds like a plan.”<br/><br/>
        And, by God, it was. Every time I had an urge to smoke, I fought it off with thoughts of tombstones and Obi-Wan
        Kenobi and a little boy trying desperately to help his old man out of a jam. Those visions were like a psy chic industrialstrength nicotine patch.<br/><br/>
        So here I am, checking off the days that I’ve been cigarette free. In fact I miss those darn things, but I’m choosing
        life over the alternative. After all, my kids need me _ although not nearly as much as I need them`

        author: `Staci Stallings`,
        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `Everyone wants to win a first-place blue ribbon, to be the best in something. Even kids in
        kindergarten want that blue ribbon. In sports, I was never a blueribbon person. In a race I
        was always last. In baseball I was likely to be hit on the head or drop the ball. In basketball
        I was fine as long as there weren’t other players on the court with me. I don’t know where I
        got my horrible sports ability, but I got it and got it early.<br/><br/>
        During the spring of my kindergarten year, our class had a field trip to a park in a town about twenty miles away.<br/><br/>
        Making that drive now is no big deal, but when you’re six and you’ve lived in a town of about 300 people all your life,
        going to a big town of a couple of thousand people is a major event. I don’t remember much of that day, but I’m sure
        we ate our little sack lunches, played on the swings and slid down the slide. Then it was time for the races.<br/><br/>
        These were no ordinary races. Someone had come up with the idea to have picnic kind of races, like pass the
        potato under your neck and hold an egg on a spoon while you run to the finish line. I don’t really remember too much
        about those, but there was one that I will never forget _ the three-legged race.<br/><br/>
        The parents decided not to use potato sacks for this particu lar event. Instead, they tied our feet together. One
        “lucky ” little boy got me for a partner. Now what you have to know about this little boy is that he was the second most
        athletic boy in our class. I’m sure he knew he was in trouble the second they laced his foot to mine. As for me, I was
        mortified. He usually won at every thing, and I knew that with me tied to him he didn’t have a chance.<br/><br/>
        Apparently, he didn’t realize that as deeply as I did at the time. He laced his arm with mine, the gun sounded and
        we were off. Couples were falling and stumbling all around us, but we stayed on our feet and made it to the other side.<br/><br/>
        Unbelievably, when we turned around and headed back for home, we were in the lead! Only one other couple had a
        chance to win, and they were a good several yards behind us.<br/><br/>
        A few feet from the finish line, disaster struck: I tripped and fell. We were close enough that my partner could have
        easily dragged me across the finish line and won. He could have, but he didn’t. Instead, he stopped, reached down and
        helped me up _ just as the other couple crossed the finish line. We received a small red ribbon for coming in second.<br/><br/>
        I still remember that moment, and I still have that little red ribbon. When we graduated thirteen years later, I
        stood on the stage and gave the valedictory address to the same group of students, none of whom even remembered
        that moment anymore. I told them about the young boy who had made a split-second decision and decided that
        helping a friend get on his feet was more important than winning a blue ribbon. I said, “One of the boys sitting up here
        on the stage is that young boy, but I won’t tell you which one he is.” I wouldn’t tell because in truth, at one time or
        another, all of them had been that little boy - helping me up when I fell, taking time out from their pur suit of their own
        goals to help a fellow person in need.<br/><br/>
        And I told them why I’d kept that red ribbon. “You see, to me that ribbon is a reminder that you don’t have to be a
        winner in the eyes of the world to be a winner to those closest to you. The world may judge you a failure or a success,
        but those closest to you will know the truth. That’s important to remember as we travel through life.”<br/><br/>
        You may not have a red ribbon to prove it, but I sincerely hope you have at least a few friends who took time out
        from their pursuit of the world’s blue ribbons to help you. I’m think ing those friends will be the ones who really count
        _ I know that such a friend was the one who counted the most to me.

        author: `Catherine Monserrat, Ph.D`,
        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `My ten-month-old baby daughter threw her arms around my neck and nuzzled her
        teardrenched cheek against my chest, desperate to get away from the doctor who had
        just fin ished a painful examination. He was a kind man who spoke to me with warm
        reassurance, but his words were any thing but reassuring, and it was all I could do to hold
        back my own tears as I stroked my child’s downy blond hair. She had been born without a
        hip socket, and the fact that it was being diagnosed so late was crucial.<br/><br/>
        The doctor said, “I recommend two years in body casts, fol lowed by at least one surgery. At that point, we’ll be
        able to determine whether she will ever be able to walk normally. Most likely, she will always have a painful, heaving
        gait.”<br/><br/>
        The essential issue was time; it was essential to begin her treatment immediately so the condition didn’t worsen.
        But the situation was worse than the doctor knew: The cost of treat ment was beyond any thing my husband and I could
        afford. It was clear I’d never see this phy sician again.<br/><br/>
        In the car, I sat down and curled my precious child in my arms. Delighted to be out of the office, she was quickly
        consoled and began to happily tap her little toes against my stom ach. Her unborn brother, due in just a few weeks,
        kicked back at her from within. Distracted by their sweet tapping rhy thm, I glanced down at the new white “walking
        shoes” I had so opti mistically purchased when she had begun to pull herself to a standing position. She would never be
        able to walk in those shoes. I was terrified she’d never walk at all.<br/><br/>
        For the next few days, I vacillated between despair and anger. For months I’d been telling my pediatrician there
        was something wrong with her legs. A longtime friend, he had patiently listened to me, but had found nothing amiss.
        Now it seemed my child was to suffer permanent damage because of the delay s. I prayed we’d find the help she needed
        and vowed to do whatever it took to find resources _ a process that turned out to be dismal. Doors seemed to close at
        every turn. Banks refused to lend us the funds for her treatment. Shrine Hospitals had long waiting lists. Far too often, I
        felt like giving up. But then my darling child would look at me with joy and trust, and I would realize she could not
        afford the luxury of my discouragement.<br/><br/>
        Finally, I received a call from the phy sician who had made the diagnosis. He had been concerned about us. Were
        we ready to begin the treatment? Embarrassed, I reported that our efforts to raise the funds had failed. After a pause,
        he said, “When I didn’t hear from you, I feared that might be the case. So I took the liberty to make a few phone calls.<br/><br/>
        I’ve learned that young families such as yours can often qualify for assistance from the Crippled Children’s Services in
        our state. I think you should call them right away.” I felt a soaring sense of optimism for the first time.<br/><br/>
        The ensuing weeks were arduous, but we were carried along on a wave of renewed hope. During that time, I gave
        birth to a wonderful new baby boy. I also waded through mountains of bureaucratic red tape to get the approval to go
        to the Children’s Hospital for an evaluation.<br/><br/>
        Sitting in the waiting room of a hospital for “crippled” children turned out to be an extraordinary experience. The
        little children, faced with all manner of phy sical chal -lenges wearing braces and casts, on crutches and in wheelchairs seemed to embody the spirit of optimism so necessary for their healing. They played, laughed and babbled with
        one another. In contrast, the parents wore worried, tired expres sions. We all were burdened by “the facts” and had to
        work much harder to maintain a sense of faith.<br/><br/>
        When our turn came, I picked up my two babies and walked in to meet the phy sician. My initial reaction was that
        this beaming man must be a lunatic. “Young lady,” he bubbled, “I have absolutely wonderful news for you. I have
        reviewed your daughter’s X ray s, and we are going to be able to provide her with state-of-the-art care. A young
        phy sician in a nearby state has been specializing in a new treatment for conditions like hers, and he has had incredible
        success. He has just made the decision to come to our hospital for a year and provide care here.” The door had opened
        wider, and the future held even greater promise than I had imagined.<br/><br/>
        The visiting phy sician’s treatment was indeed revolutionary. His surgical procedure was to put a chip of bone
        where the missing hip socket should have been, and after the surgery my daughter was put in a body cast and sent
        home with us. Unseen, beneath the thick layers of plaster, a miracle began to grow. Every time they took an X ray, I
        could see that the small chip of bone was gradually growing and shaping itself into the form of a perfect hip socket.<br/><br/>
        The surgery was 100 percent successful. After the cast was removed, my little daughter walked pain free and
        without a limp.<br/><br/>
        I still remember the visiting nurse coming to our home for a follow-up visit a year later to see the child with the
        hip dislo -cation. I pointed to our daughter as she ran through the room squealing after her brother. “ No,” the nurse
        said patiently. “I’m here to visit the child who had surgery for her missing hip socket.” Then the light dawned and she
        said, “This is amazing. I’ve never seen a child recover so fully and in such a short period of time.”<br/><br/>
        My daughter is now a grown woman with a family of her own. We rarely speak of her experience. The only
        reminder is a small scar on the front of her hip, a scar so insignificant she has been able to pursue a career in modeling.<br/><br/>
        Recently, she and I went roller-skating with her young daughter. As my granddaughter launched herself confidently
        onto the skating floor, my daughter and I began our somewhat wobbly, but valiant effort at merging with the other
        skaters. When they called for a “couple’s skate,” she and I joined hands as we had so often when she was little. As I
        watched our feet gliding along, I was suddenly struck by the sight of her skates and remembered the little white shoes
        of the child who could not walk. As we skated along, they began to play “Just the Two of Us.”<br/><br/>
        I, too, have been forever changed. Out of my despair of not knowing where to turn, I learned to trust. I appreciate
        the impor tance of listening to my own instincts. From persisting in the face of adversity, I discovered that many of
        life’s possibilities are unseen, yet may be ready to materialize in the next moment. Despite appearances to the
        contrary, our bodies carry within them great wisdom and the ability to heal in miraculous ways, and somewhere there
        are always caring and capable people who are willing to lend support. Out of challenges that seemed too heavy for my
        twenty-one-year-old shoulders to carry, came lessons that have carried me throughout my life.

        and wisdom. That philosophy was tested and ultimately deepened during a series of sur
        prising and challenging incidents at the age of twenty-six in the year 1979.<br/><br/>
        The previous year I had run my first under-three-hour marathon and, armed with the
        goal of improving that time, I intensified my training. By midsummer I was running seventy miles per week and
        keeping up with much faster runners for the first time in my racing career. My training partners included elite-level
        runners whose presence and encouragement con tributed to my progress. They told me I could run a 2:40 marathon
        (two hours and forty minutes), with the potential to reach 2:20, given the progress in our training. Running had
        become both a phy sical and spiritual passion in my life, and I was riding a wave of rising excitement and bliss.<br/><br/>
        That all came to a grinding halt when I developed a painful injury in my knee. From running an effortless twenty
        miles at a fast tempo in the mountains, I could now barely run one mile. The pain increased until I couldn’t even run a
        few steps without sharp pain. I decided to rest a few weeks, expecting to return to my training. As the weeks passed,
        however, my body experi enced no improvement and my spirits sank. The doctors were unable to predict when I
        might recover. With each passing day, I could see the benefits of my hard, progressive work of the last six months
        ebbing away, and I grew increasingly disheartened.<br/><br/>
        I had to find some way to sustain my fitness as my knee healed. My body had grown accustomed to the rigors of
        training for two or more hours a day. It felt imperative that I keep my cardiovascular sy stem strong and not lose the
        gains of the last half-year. I bought some swimming goggles, joined the local YMCA (Y oung Men’s Christan
        Association) and set about duplicating my training regimen, assuming I’d soon be able to swim for several hours a day.
        I was about to receive my second difficult lesson in dealing with challenges and setbacks.<br/><br/>
        I had a smattering of swim lessons as a kid and believed that, as a marathoner, I would have no problems with a
        transition to the pool. But the first day I plunged into the water, it was painfully apparent that my expectations far
        exceeded my ability. After swimming only one length of the pool, I stopped and clung to the edge, gasping and winded.<br/><br/>
        I tried a second lap with the same result. This continued for about twenty minutes, one lap at a time. I was exhausted.<br/><br/>
        I recalled that while growing up in New Y ork I had little exposure to swimming. I didn’t really like being in the
        water. In fact, the ocean frightened me. I remembered when a camp counselor forced us to stay out in the ocean for
        “our full thirty minutes,” despite the chilling water temperature. A poor swimmer, I found the waves intimidating.<br/><br/>
        Even as an adult I had rarely ventured into the sea.<br/><br/>
        In early July, determined to solve my dilemma, I befriended the lifeguard. He patiently guided me seven days a
        week. I worked hard, determined to improve, but progress was slow. I would swim everyday until exhausted; then I’d
        wait a few minutes and try a few more laps. Week by week, my effort and his coaching and encouragement began to pay
        off.<br/><br/>
        By August I was swimming nearly forty laps a day. In September I swam a mile a day, learned the breaststroke,
        back-stroke and crawl, and even started lifesaving lessons. Feeling more competent, my confidence grew and I pushed
        onward. By December I could swim two miles a day and felt as com fortable in the water as I had running on land.
        By the Christmas holidays, my knee had improved, but it was not yet ready for running. So I decided to travel to
        Hawaii, hitchhike around the islands and camp on the beaches. This seemed an idy llic break _ and besides, my budget
        didn’t allow for much else.<br/><br/>
        I learned soon after my arrival, however, that during this period in the islands, tensions between locals and
        tourists had reached a peak. Newspapers and radio reports had related several incidents of campers being burned out
        of their tents and visitors being assaulted at night by locals. As I made my way around Maui, I was repeatedly warned
        to be cautious when hitchhiking and especially careful if sleeping on the beach.<br/><br/>
        Hearing this news, I remember standing on Makena Beach late that afternoon, feeling vulnerable, depressed and
        alone, when a distant scream pulled me out of my dark reverie. It was a voice crying “Help!” from the ocean. I looked
        out to see sev eral figures bobbing in the ocean beyond large, crashing waves. Without thinking, I threw off my shirt
        and shoes and raced into the water. Swimming through the rough surf I found two men in their twenties holding up a
        terrified, much older man. They said they were exhausted from the riptide and had no strength left to bring him in.<br/><br/>
        They asked me to take over so they could swim to the beach and get help.<br/><br/>
        The older man started panicking, grabbing my neck and pulling me under as huge waves thrashed us. I grabbed
        him firmly, looked directly into his terrified eyes and said, “Do what I tell you and I promise I won’t let you die.” He
        nodded and stopped struggling. I turned him on his back, held him with my left arm and, using all the strength of my
        right arm, started to swim against the riptide. The surf was very terrible. A fierce storm two days earlier had shifted the
        sand and left behind enormous waves and an even more ferocious undertow. Sharp coral to the east precluded
        swimming at an angle to the beach. I would have to overcome the waves and swim straight in, against the riptide,
        towing the weight of an exhausted elderly man.<br/><br/>
        At first I swam with all my strength, thinking my fitness would be enough. I quickly tired, however, in the strong
        surf and undertow, which repeatedly pulled us out back into the sea as if we were weightless corks. I realized I had to
        conserve my energy _ not only to make it back in with this man, but to save my own life as well.<br/><br/>
        Little by little, I neared the beach, trying to ride each wave and swim when propelled forward. After an eternity,
        struggling with waves and riptide, I pulled the man within thirty feet of the beach and placed him into the arms of the
        other rescuers.<br/><br/>
        I staggered out of the water and collapsed onto the beach, breathing hard. Then I stumbled away from the rescue
        group and the elderly man, to sit alone with my thoughts, which were rushing back in like the tide. Only minutes earlier
        I had been standing on the beach consumed by my own problems. Now, a few paces down the beach lay a man whose
        life I had saved. My past concerns disappeared. His cry for help had pushed me to a place far beyond my inward
        troubles and personal predicaments _ past my fear of the ocean into an act of courage and strength.<br/><br/>
        I never again spoke to the man I saved. I never even learned his name. It wasn’t necessary. He was safe,
        surrounded by the group. Life’s incredible lessons and opportunities had again worked their magic.<br/><br/>
        The knee injury that seemed to end my marathon dreams had catapulted me into choices and events that had a
        profound effect in my life _ and had saved the life of another human being. It struck me then how the interconnected
        threads of our destiny are profoundly tied to one another. I used to wonder if things happen for a reason. Now I
        believe I understand: When things happen, it’s our job to make the best use of the events. Every thing that happens is a
        chance to grow, to create something positive out of a negative. When one door closes, another always opens. It’s our
        job to pay attention.<br/><br/>

        contentEn: `One autumn evening I slipped my kayak into the water, knowing it was late to start
        another leg of my dream voyage. I was nineteen years old, and one month into a
        kayaking journey around the southern half of North America from Vancouver to my
        home in the Saint John on the east coast of Canada via Lake Nicaragua and the San
        Juan River. Today’s destination: the town of Westport, Washington.<br/><br/>
        A westerly wind gusted in my face, pushing huge waves at me as if to say, “Go back.” A half-hour later, I was a mile
        from land _ exhausted, wet, cold and aching. I kicked myself for not wearing my protective waterproof suit. If I make
        another mistake, it will be my last, I thought. Although the wind and waves smashing against my face, I tried hard to
        make forward progress.<br/><br/>
        I paddled on with a surge of power beyond my normal capacity. Fear gave me strength. To stop paddling wasn’t
        simply an option. So I sang to distract myself from my aching body and burning arms, but songs could not stop the
        fading light.<br/><br/>
        A half-mile from Westport, a massive mud flat blocked my path. I couldn’t stay here _ the flat would be covered
        with water when the tide came up. But the only way around would take me two miles out of my way, and I didn’t have
        that kind of time left. It would soon turn dark, and I would be too far out to make it to shore. I desperately needed dry
        land.<br/><br/>
        I dragged my kayak up onto the slab of mud so I could assess the situation. To my surprise, I found myself
        standing not on a mud flat, as it had appeared in the dusk, but on an island. That made me feel cheerful, and I pulled on
        my waterproof suit and headed back out immediately. I was warm now and knew where I was going. Fatigue had
        turned to elation.<br/><br/>
        As I paddled around the lee side of the little island, hundreds of pelicans rose into the sky above me. With their
        large wings and long beaks these birds resemble pterodacty ls, flying reptiles from eons ago. The sheer numbers of
        them filled me with awe. As the pelicans ascended, their silhouettes seemed suspended against the brilliant pink and
        orange sunset.<br/><br/>
        Not long after, I arrived at a marina and began looking for a large boat to dock beside. I searched for a friendly
        soul someone who would let me sleep on deck aboard his vessel. I paddled alongside a large yacht on whose stern
        was painted “Mystic Rose Vancouver.” Through a porthole, I saw a man inside browsing nautical charts. Soon after
        docking, I boarded and presented my request. The man in his thirties, traveling alone and not a Canadian as I had
        assumed lived in Vancouver, Washington.<br/><br/>
        While I was cooking supper in the cabin, Kerry made a suggestion that would change the course of my entire
        voyage:<br/><br/>
        “How about pulling your kayak on board and sailing with me down to Astoria? Sailing solo is tough.”<br/><br/>
        “I’d really like to,” I replied, “but I can’t. I’m aiming to paddle the entire distance by myself.” The truth was that I
        wanted to learn how to sail and wished to join him. Still. I felt driven by pride and independence _ and a need to prove
        that I could set a course and stay with it. I wasn’t someone who chose the easy way out. I wanted to be someone
        admired and respected for his courage and determination.<br/><br/>
        “I need to do this alone,” I repeated. Hearing my own words, I realized that I sounded like someone trying to
        convince others and maybe myself that I was cool.<br/><br/>
        I asked myself why I took this journey, and why I had to paddle the entire distance. This journey wasn’t just about
        kayaking, I realized. It never had been. It was about meeting people, having experiences and learning from both. It
        was about living life to its fullest, not waiting until I was too old to have great adventures, to appreciate that everyday
        I’m healthy and free is precious.<br/><br/>
        I had vowed to paddle the whole way because of pride _ so I could say, “I did it by myself.” But at what cost? What
        was pride worth when I paddled alone through the waves? Was myself-image more important than making a friend,
        learning something new and having fun in the process?<br/><br/>
        Kerry let me sail the yacht most of the way. He even let me take the wheel as we sailed through the Columbia River
        bar, where many ships have gone down (one of the most dangerous places to sail in North America).<br/><br/>
        We arrived in Astoria at four o’clock that afternoon. For supper, Kerry took me out for Chinese food. At the end of
        our meal, I opened my fortune cookie.<br/><br/>
        It read: “Now is the time to try something new.”`

        was one hundred and two years old. “There’s a sore under my denture,” she said. “I told my own
        dentist it’s nothing, but he insisted I come see you.”<br/><br/>
        Her eighty-year-old son accompanied her. He would occa sionally attempt to add something to
        her story but she would say, “Hush up, son!” She wanted to tell it herself.<br/><br/>
        I found a large cancer that extended over much of the roof of her mouth. A biopsy later confirmed the diagnosis
        a particularly bad sort of cancer.<br/><br/>
        During her next appointment, I explained to her the serious ness of the problem. She reached down, clasped my
        hand in hers and said, “I know you’re worried about me, but I’m just fine.”<br/><br/>
        I knew differently. After considerable effort on my part, and kindness on her part because she wanted to please
        me, she consented to have me refer her to a cancer surgeon. She saw him, but as I expected, declined treatment.<br/><br/>
        About six months later she returned to my office.<br/><br/>
        “How are you?” I asked. Her son started to speak, but she told him to hush once again.<br/><br/>
        “I’m just fine,” she said to me. “When can I get started on fixing my denture?”<br/><br/>
        I sputtered, “Let me take a look in your mouth and we’ll see about it.” I was thinking, no way.<br/><br/>
        I couldn’t believe my eyes. The cancer that had covered nearly the entire roof of her mouth was gone only one
        small area of redness remained.<br/><br/>
        I had read of such things happening, but had never actually seen them with my own eyes. I was dumbfounded.<br/><br/>
        “You see, honey? Like I told you, I’m fine,” she said, patting my antiseptically gloved hand.<br/><br/>
        Now I believed her.<br/><br/>
        That was my first miracle. Since then I’ve seen many others, because they keep getting easier to see. In fact,
        miracles are daily events for me now. Every time I remember to take a slow, deep breath, I think about the miracle of
        being alive. And people are a miracle, for through them we have a chance to know ourselves and to love beyond
        ourselves. We have a chance to show kindness, to provide service, and to see the miracles of one another.<br/><br/>
        Since my first miracle, I’ve come to understand that the time and place for a miracle is wherever we choose to find
        it.`

        contentEn: `My world had come apart and I thought, nothing or no one can ever help me repair it. I
        was fresh from eight weeks in the hospital after a wretched accident in which I had lost
        my right arm and a few other mundane parts and pieces at the age of sixty-three. My
        blessed family was there through every grueling surgery. With each awakening I was
        ecstatic to be alive, until ghastly thoughts would take hold of my mind and force
        reality to creep back in. Self-pity was eating me up, and homesickness often overwhelmed me. (I still find myself a
        cranky old fussbudget if away from my home for more than two days.)<br/><br/>
        I was released from the hospital after two months. When at last I looked up to behold the big curved log gateway
        over my drive, my carefully burned lettering on the ranch sign hanging beneath the gate, and my beloved kids and
        grandkids running to greet me, I felt renewed, reborn. A small blackish cloud passed beneath the sun releasing a short
        July drencher as the youngsters tried to help their bedraggled Granny up toward the deck where our Molly and her
        Mike were shish-kabobbing.<br/><br/>
        “The kids need you, Granny,” pleaded Mol, as she planted a kiss on my cheek and announced she was pregnant
        again. “They need to touch their Gran.” My littlest babes grabbed onto my left arm lest I should topple over. We lifted
        our legs high and waded barefoot through the glistening wet grass where a sea of blossoms had raised their heads to
        drink. It smelled delicious.<br/><br/>
        “Are you okay, Gran? Do you want a glass of juice?” queried my sweet Mikal.<br/><br/>
        “No, my darlin’, not now,” I whispered. As we picked dande lions and wild flowers for the dinner table, I was
        acutely aware of my surroundings _more than ever before. Suddenly my Jamie stared down at her bouquet and
        mumbled, “You’re not going to die, are you Granny?”<br/><br/>
        The next morning I arose and slipped out into the sunshine to look and listen to miracles embracing me. The
        mallards were completely engrossed in caring for their eggs _ nested warmly under carefully fashioned bits of grass
        and straw. The hens took turns scurrying into Duck Soup Waterfowl Refuge to flap their wings and drown their feathers
        before returning to the nest for a few more hours of incubating. “Only a few more days,” I reminded them out loud.<br/><br/>
        “Then all your worries begin.” Our donkey family had finally shed their scruffy winter coats and looked so fine, all
        decked out in silky coats.“And what did Mary ride to Bethlehem on?” I called out. As she sensed my frailties, Sweet
        Pea, whimpered ever so softly instead of her usual full-blown heehaw. She lifted her head and sniffed the air as I walked
        toward her, then all five suddenly jumped and fled.<br/><br/>
        I knew I looked different now, but that was okay. I had lots of time and so did they. I could hardly wait to walk the
        earth... to breathe in the scent of lodge pole pine... to feel the sweet breezes that made the pond ripple... to listen to the
        piercing sounds of birds whose melodies are heard only by those who bother to listen. The cottontails sat up to ogle
        while their wee ones scurried out of the grass before me.<br/><br/>
        Our big forested mountain was still there, and I knew this was the place I would feed my soul _ forever. As I
        meandered over the uneven pasture toward the woods, in hopes the shooting stars had bloomed, I thought I heard a
        cry.<br/><br/>
        Our dog, Keesha, stopped to listen and sniff _ it was prob ably only a bird. We had taken only a few more steps,
        however, and there before us hung a spotted fawn caught up on the farm fence. I quietly ordered Keesha to stay while I
        drew closer. The fawn cried like a baby as I threw my bandaged stump under her chest, lifted slightly and untangled
        her hoof with my good hand. Anyone coming upon the scene would have surely thought I had lost my mind. As we
        both fell to the ground, the mama leapt over the fence squealing at the top of her lungs. Here I was, this old broadlying
        in a field, caressing a spotted fawn with half an arm, while Keesha wagged her tail and slurped my face in utter joy.<br/><br/>
        “Okay, okay, Mama, we’re leaving,” I yelled to the doe. With that she and her child ran off into the aspens. I
        couldn’t help but laugh out loud and boast to Keesha as I rolled over and got to my feet. “ I’ve been home less than a
        day and already I’m a hero. I can do any thing, even save a life.”<br/><br/>
        And save lives I did as the years have flown by. I was, and still am, slightly insecure, and every time I get to feeling
        that life has dealt me a bum blow, I look around at others in such terrible trouble and thank God for allowing this
        wretch to live and love all who enter her life. That little fawn will always be in my prayers, for she was a part of my
        healing that fateful day. Thank you, little fawn, thank you.<br/><br/>

        contentEn: `January is a good time for beginnings, so for years I have had the habit of seeing all my assorted
        doctors soon after the New Year. Two weeks of being poked, prodded and probed by internists,
        gynecologist and radiologists while clad in a paper dress that makes me feel like a large lamb
        chop in a badly made grill. When it’s all over I feel virtuous, reassured that I am not dead and
        able to make intelligent decisions about how to stay that way for a while longer.<br/><br/>
        Despite being too fat for my height or too short for my weight, I’ve always had low blood
        pressure and cholesterol, a slow pulse, lots of energy and the ability to wrap my legs around my
        own head a pointless and unaesthetic exercise, perhaps, but it keeps me limber and frightens off burglars.<br/><br/>
        However, throughout most of 1996, problems I confronted in writing my new book had squashed my usual
        optimism. It was all I could do to maintain the discipline of writing something everyday. My few healthy habits
        vanished. I stopped my daily walk and swim, and I was living on ice cream, pork rinds and mayonnaise. This regime
        soon made me feel rotten lethargic, creaky and even more depressed. My arthritic joints ached and I was chomping
        Rolaids by the handful as I watched daytime television for a writer, a sure sign of phy sical, mental and spiritual
        decay.<br/><br/>
        I went to a New Year’s Eve party at a friend’s house, stayed the night to avoid the drunks on the highways and got
        to bed around two. When I awoke at 6 A.M., as usual, I lay there, staring at the ceiling and thinking about my life. When
        the others got up, we still sat blearily around the living room with mugs of cof fee, and someone asked, “Has anyone
        made any New Year’s resolutions?”<br/><br/>
        “I have,” I said into the laughter. “I’m going to walk for twenty minutes four days a week, and eat five servings of
        fruits and vegetables everyday.” This rather dull statement was greeted with polite murmurs, and then the discussion
        turned to the more interesting subject of what to have for breakfast.<br/><br/>
        I began the month with my customary round of doctors, and found to my horror that I was in even worse shape
        than I thought. My blood pressure and cholesterol were sky high, and I had gained twenty pounds in a year. No
        wonder my knees hurt. I was now carrying the equivalent of an extra person on my belly, thighs and buttocks. This
        news, instead of depressing me further, made me angry _ not with myself, not at the doc tors, not even at those evil
        publishers and editors who had made my life so miserable. I was just plain angry. And that anger spurred me to action.<br/><br/>
        I drafted Sally, my new internist, into my war on the midlife blahs. I told her I didn’t want any advice about diet
        and exer cise; I had been reading and writing about food and fitness for years. I needed her to monitor my blood
        pressure and choles terol, but mostly I wanted her moral support. Sally is much younger than I, and I think she was
        taken aback at first by the large, belligerent, extraordinarily naked woman on her examin ing table, but she agreed to
        see me once a month for a checkup and chat, and soon she became my strongest ally.<br/><br/>
        I began walking everyday, twice around the half-mile circle near my apartment. The twenty-minute walk made
        me breathless at first, and I could hear my knee joints clicking with every step. I could even hear the seductive voice
        in my head whispering a million reasons not to walk, but I usually managed to ignore it.<br/><br/>
        I’m an excellent cook, so the large quantities of vegetables and fruits I added to my diet tasted great. I hadn’t
        eliminated or restricted any food, so I never felt deprived. What I did feel was gassy. My digestive sy stem, startled by
        all this roughage after so many years of fatty, salty, sugary smoothage, expressed itself in loud seismic rumblings and
        explosions. It’s a good thing I’m not a smoker.<br/><br/>
        After a few weeks, however, this side effect passed, and I began to feel better. I wasn’t 100 percent consis tent; I
        had occasional relapses into excessive amounts of fudge ripple ice cream and television, but most days I walked and
        ate my greens.<br/><br/>
        My weight dropped from month to month, sometimes quickly, sometimes not. The blood pressure and cholesterol
        proved more stubborn, but after six months, the changes began to show.<br/><br/>
        It has been eight months now. My blood pressure is normal, and I’ve lost forty pounds. I can see my feet without
        bending over, and my knees don’t hurt. For me, a mile is an easy walk, and I danced all night at my nephew’s wedding
        with hardly a creak or gasp. However, the demons of depression, with their weapons of fatigue, apathy, insomnia and
        doubt still plague me now and then.<br/><br/>
        Publishers are as obtuse as ever, and I still have days when walking, broccoli and coherent sentences are all
        beyond my reach.<br/><br/>
        But at fifty-two I’m doing okay. The world looks good to me most of the time, and the face in the mirror pleases
        me. I like the feel of a brisk walk in the rain. I’m strengthened by the love and support I get from friends, family and a
        doctor who takes the time to listen. I rejoice in so simple things: my cat washing her face in a sunny window, a dark red
        nasturtium blooming on my balcony, a phone call from my sis ter or an hour over coffee with a new friend.<br/><br/>
        I will never be an ascetic who actually likes steamed tofu and working out. I will always preferlying in a hammock
        with a cat, a book and a large bag of Oreos. But once I’m out I enjoy my walk, and a baked potato with a glass of
        buttermilk tastes very good when I’m hungry. A good night’s sleep, silent knee joints and a cheerful vitality feel much
        better than my sad, sluggish state of a year ago _ occasional demons notwithstanding.<br/><br/>
        My New Year’s resolution demanded not a destination, but a journey that, like all journey s, began with one small
        step. I have no advice for others no maps, prescriptions or platitudes no idea of where I will end up, or how I’ll get
        there. I only know that the trip is worth taking, the scenery is always interesting and the only way to begin, is to begin`

        name: `“Rags” to riches`,
        title: ``,
        author: `Woody Woodburn`,
        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `Ragnar Arnesen’s nickname is “Rags.” His father, Erik, calls him this; he also calls his son a
        hero.<br/><br/>
        Ragnar, named after his Norwegian grandfather, was born in San Francisco and grew
        up near the waves in Manhattan Beach. At age eleven he learned to surf. But the crashing
        waves, ca pable of breaking his surfboard in two, posed less of a threat to Rags than his own bloodsugar level. He was diagnosed with diabetes while still an infant, and his blood sugar could crash
        worse than any wave, leaving him helpless in the ocean.<br/><br/>
        Nearly two decades ago, Erik Arnesen himself an avid surfer in the sixties took his son to San Onofre state beach
        for the first time. After giving Rags a lesson on dry land, Erik went into the deep water to ride some curls _ alone.<br/><br/>
        “I just couldn’t get out there,” Rags, now thirty, describes. “I kept paddling and paddling, but that first day I could
        never get past the white water where the surf breaks.”<br/><br/>
        While another, less insightful father might have considered his son’s failure a lack of talent, Erik focused on
        something else.<br/><br/>
        “I saw what a fighter he was,” Erik recalls. “I offered to help him, but he was determined. He wasn’t going to let the
        frustration defeat him. And that became our credo: “Whatever it is you want in life, you have to paddle out to get it.”<br/><br/>
        Rags has since paddled through storm surf and tsunamis (tidal waves).<br/><br/>
        His big trouble began when he was thirteen and diagnosed with kidney problems. The doctors said he would need
        a trans plant within six months. Rags would hold out for an extra six and a half years.<br/><br/>
        “I refused to let my condition stop me from doing things,” he says. So he surfed, he cy cled and he ran varsity cross
        country at Mira Costa High _ all with failing kidneys and a malfunc tioning pancreas because of severe diabetes.<br/><br/>
        That first day Rags tried to surf is nothing compared to the time he was training to run the Manhattan Beach with
        his father a few years later. On the eve of the race, Ragnar’s blood-sugar level had a wipeout. He was rushed to the ER
        by ambu lance. “It was touch-and-go,” Erik remembers.<br/><br/>
        The scare abated at 5:30 the next morning when Rags insisted on leaving the hospital to run. The doctors strongly
        advised against it, but Erik knew his son.<br/><br/>
        “I knew if he allowed his diabetes to keep him from running the race, it would have damaged him for the rest of his
        life,” explains Erik, himself a four-hour marathoner and a cy clist, too. “We took sugar cubes for Rags to suck on while
        he ran, for a quick energy lift, until he could get an insulin shot after he completed the race.”<br/><br/>
        Whatever it is you want in life, you have to paddle out to get it.<br/><br/>
        The disease worsened. Rags paddled. “Even in the most dif ficult times,” he says, “if I could go surfing with my dad
        I knew things were okay. And even with my obstacles, sports make me appreciate life more... much more. When I’m
        cy cling, running or surfing especially surfing I feel totally alive.”<br/><br/>
        Finally, the doctors told Rags that he had to have a trans plant immediately. He and Erik went to their favorite surf
        spot. There, out on the ocean swells, waiting for the next set of waves, then they picked a date to do the operation. On
        December 19, 1990, twenty-one-year-old Ragnar checked into UCLA Medical Center to get a new kidney. A fifty-one
        year-old kidney from his dad.<br/><br/>
        Sometimes you can’t paddle alone. Sometimes we all need some help getting past the white water.<br/><br/>
        “It was a no-brainer,” Erik says of his decision.<br/><br/>
        Five days later, on Christmas Eve, father and son left the hospital together. Rags felt more energetic than he had in
        years, and Erik was in considerable discomfort. “But I never felt better,” he says.<br/><br/>
        Rags returned to Chico State, where he was majoring in biol ogy. In six weeks he rejoined the university cy cling
        team. He continued taking six to ten insulin shots a day to keep his dia betes under control.<br/><br/>
        Then the clouds returned _ another tsunami hit Rags head-on.<br/><br/>
        While Rags competed at the 1995 World Transplant Games in Manchester, England, his body began to reject his
        father’s donated kidney. For five years, the son and father had shared their flesh. Now they shared their anguish.<br/><br/>
        “I felt terrible for him,” Erik says, “but I also felt bad for myself. I wanted my kidney to work for him _ now
        whatever I had done for him was over.”<br/><br/>
        Gone too, was Rags’ fighting spirit. For the first time in his life, he didn’t feel like paddling.<br/><br/>
        “My life felt upside-down. I had been a fit athlete; now I was on kidney dialy sis.”<br/><br/>
        The first three months were especially difficult for Rags.<br/><br/>
        “I finally decided I could do two things,” Rags recollects. “I could feel sorry for myself, or I could accept it.”<br/><br/>
        Whatever it is you want in life, you have to paddle out to get it.<br/><br/>
        Rags paddled. With the help of his mother, Xenia, he studied about dialy sis and nutrition to better manage his
        condition. And paddled: He earned his Emergency Medical Technician degree and started working twelve-hour shifts
        between his Monday, Wednesday and Friday “part-time job,” as he called his four-hour dialy sis treatments. And
        paddled: He surfed, cy cled and started training for a triathlon, which, while on dialy sis, is like climbing Mount Everest
        carrying a 200-pound backpack. Rags never completed that triathlon, but not for the reason you might think. He
        skipped it because the day before the race a kidney match was found.<br/><br/>
        A year earlier, the rejection of his father’s kidney had seemed the cruelest of fates. Now it turned out to be the
        greatest of blessings. This time, Rags was the recipient of a kidney transplant that not only restored his kidney
        function, but ended his diabetes as well.<br/><br/>
        “When I woke up, I wasn’t diabetic anymore!” said Ragnar, the excitement still in his voice three years later. “It
        has been a miracle.”<br/><br/>
        In September 1999, Ragnar joined a contin gent of international athletes who have donated organs in their bodies
        at the 1999 XII World Transplant Games in Budapest, Hungary.<br/><br/>
        For Rags who competed in cycling, track and field, and volleyball it was his eighth international game. He has
        won more than a dozen medals, all silver and bronze.<br/><br/>
        “I’m still looking for my first gold,” the five-feet, seven-inch, 130-pound athlete says. “I’d like to give it to my
        dad.”<br/><br/>
        But Erik says he already has something better: a collage of pictures of Rags at various Transplant Games, inscribed
        by his son with the words from Bette Midler’s popular song, “The Wind Beneath My Wings.”<br/><br/>
        Erik Arnesen has known great striving and adventure in his own right. But his greatest hero and treasure is his son.<br/><br/>
        A “Rags” to riches story, indeed.`

        author: `Hanoch McCarty`,
        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `I often wonder how people survive childhood and adolescence at all, don't you? Children
        take so many risks and do so many crazy things that it's hard to see how they manage to
        get through them all.<br/><br/>
        I must admit that I personally was still an angry adolescent in my first years of
        college. My anger was diffuse - the world didn't please me in almost any way. My anger was
        focused - my parents didn't please me at all. I chafed under my father's direction and correction.<br/><br/>
        Our finances were limited, so I chose to go to a local college and commute to classes everyday. One day I had a
        serious fight with my father. I saw him as controlling me and wanted to break free. He saw me as rebellious and tried to
        reassert his authority. We both exploded in shouts. I stormed out of the house and missed my bus to school. I knew
        that catching the next bus meant I would be late to myeducation class. That made me even more furious.<br/><br/>
        I fumed and sighed all the way to school. My mind raced with angry thoughts about my father. Like many
        adolescents, I was stuck in my egocentricity - certain that no one in the world had ever had such a terrible father or
        had to contend with such unfairness. After all, my father hadn't even finished high school, and here I was, a mighty
        college student! I felt so superior to him. How dare he interfere with my life and my plans?<br/><br/>
        As I ran across the sprawling campus toward the building where my class met, I suddenly realized that I didn't
        have the assignment that was due: a thought card.<br/><br/>
        This class was taught by Dr. Sidney B. Simon, one of the most unusual teachers at the school. His policies were
        unique, his grading policy revolutionary, his teaching methods unsettling. People talked about Dr. Simon.<br/><br/>
        During our first class, Professor Simon had explained, "Every Tuesday, you must bring in an index card with your
        name and the date on the top line. As for what's on the rest of the card, that's up to you. You can write a thought, a
        concern, a feeling, a question or just plain any thing that's on your mind. It's your way of communicating with me
        directly. These cards will be completely confidential. I will return them to you every Wednesday. You'll find that I will
        write comments on your cards. If you ask a question, I'll do my level best to answer it. If you have a concern, I will
        respond to that as best I can. And remember, this card is your admission ticket to class on Tuesdays."<br/><br/>
        On the first Tuesday of the class, I dutifully brought in my index card with my name and the date written carefully
        on the top line. I then added, "All that glitters is not gold."The following day, Dr. Simon returned the cards to the class.<br/><br/>
        Mine had a penciled note: "What does this quote mean to you? Is it significant?"This comment made me uneasy.<br/><br/>
        Apparently, he was taking these cards seriously. I surely didn't want to reveal myself to him.<br/><br/>
        The week progressed. The course met everyday for one hour. Dr. Simon was quite brilliant. He taught by asking
        questions, raising issues that none of our teachers had ever mentioned before. He challenged us to think, and to think
        deeply. Social issues, political issues, personal issues all were grist for the mill in this class.<br/><br/>
        At first, I thought he was going to propagandize us for or against something, but not Professor Simon. Instead, he
        simply asked us to think, explore, research, question and then come up with our own responses. Frankly, I became
        even more uncomfortable. There was something delightful, refreshing and inviting about his teaching, but since I had
        not experienced this sty le, I had no "coping strategies" to help me deal with him. I knew how to do well in a class: sit up
        front; tell the teacher how much you "enjoyed" the lecture; turn in neat, typed papers written according to a formula;
        and memorize, memorize, memorize! But this class was clearly something different. I couldn't use these timeworn
        methods to pass.<br/><br/>
        The second Tuesday came. I wrote on my card, "A rolling stone gathers no moss."Not trusting him, I covered
        myself with humor, which had always been my best defense against unwanted closeness. The next day the card came
        back with this note: "Y ou seem to have a sense of humor. Is this an important part of your life?"<br/><br/>
        What did he want? What was going on here? I couldn't remember a teacher caring personally about me since
        elementary school. What did this man want?<br/><br/>
        Now, I raced down the hallway, ten minutes late to class. Just outside the door, I took an index card from my
        notebook and wrote my name and the date on it. Desperate for something to write on it, I could only think about the
        fight I'd just had with my dad. "I am the son of an idiot!" I wrote and then dashed into the room. He stood, conducting a
        discussion, near the door. Looking up at me, he reached out for the card, and I handed it to him and took my seat. The
        moment I reached my seat, I felt overwhelmed with dread.<br/><br/>
        What had I done? I gave him that card! Oh, no! I didn't mean to let that out. Now he'll know about my anger, about
        my dad, about my life! I don't remember any thing about the rest of that class session. All I could think about was the
        card.<br/><br/>
        I had difficulty sleeping that night, filled with a dread. What could these cards be all about? Why did I tell him that
        about my dad? Suppose he contacts my dad? What business is it of his anyway?<br/><br/>
        Wednesday morning arrived, and I reluctantly got ready for school. I came to class quite early and sat in back.<br/><br/>
        The class began, and Dr. Simon began giving back the thought cards. He put mine on the desk facedown as was his usual
        practice. I picked it up, almost unable to turn it over.<br/><br/>
        When I looked at the face of the card, I discovered he had written, "What does the 'son of an idiot' do with the rest
        of his life?" It felt like someone had punched me in the stomach. I had spent a lot of time hanging out in the student
        union cafeteria talking with other young men about the problems I had "because of my parents."And they, too, shared
        the same sort of material with me. No one challenged anyone to take responsibility for themselves. No, we each
        accepted the others' blame-the-parents game with relief. It was all our parents' fault. If we did poorly on tests, blame
        Mom. If we just missed getting a student-aide job, blame Dad. I constantly complained about my folks, and all the guys
        nodded sagely. These folks who were paying the tuition were certainly an interfering bunch of fools.<br/><br/>
        Professor Simon's innocent-seeming question punctured that balloon. It got right to the heart of the issue: Whose
        problem is it?<br/><br/>
        I skipped going to the student union that day and went straight home, strangely depressed. All evening I thought
        about it and about something my mother had said: "The millionaire calls himself a 'self-made man,' but if he gets
        arrested, he blames his abusive parents."<br/><br/>
        I wish I could say that I experienced a magic transformation, but I didn't. However, Dr. Simon's comment was
        insidious. It kept coming up in my mind over the next few weeks. Again and again, as I blamed my father for this or
        that, a little internal voice said, "Okay, suppose your father is all those bad things you said. How long do you think you
        can get away with blaming him?"<br/><br/>
        Slowly, my thinking began to shift. I heard myself blaming a lot. After a while, I realized that I had created a life in
        which I was not a central figure! I was the object of the action, not the subject. That felt even more uncomfortable than
        any feeling I had in Dr. Simon's class. I didn't want to be a puppet. I wanted to be an actor, not a re-actor.<br/><br/>
        The process of growth wasn't easy or fast. It took over a year before people began to notice that I was taking
        responsibility for my own actions, my own choices, my own feelings. I was surprised at how my grades improved in all
        my subjects. I was astounded at the increase in the number - and quality - of my friends.<br/><br/>
        All through this process, I kept sending in my thought cards. Later, I took another course with this unique
        professor. I worked harder for him than I had in any other classes I had ever taken.<br/><br/>
        Several years later, I was surprised at my own progress. From a trivial student, I had become a successful student
        and then a successful high school teacher. I went from constant anger and constant avoidance of the necessary work in
        my life to become someone who was energized, excited, purposeful and even joy ful.<br/><br/>
        My relationship with my father also improved. Instead of controlling, now I saw him as concerned and caring. I
        recognized that he didn't have "smooth"ways of parenting me but that his intentions were very loving. The fights
        diminished and finally disappeared. I had learned to see my father as a smart, wise and loving man. And it all started
        with a question, an innocent-seeming question`

        contentEn: `Jeff and I had many conversations during the school year, but I will always remember the
        time he told me about his family. His mother, a loving, caring woman, was the one who
        held the family together. She died shortly before Jeff graduated from high school. Jeff's
        father, a successful phy sician, cold and stern in Jeff's words, had firm beliefs that a person
        would never make a valuable contribution to the world unless they attended and
        graduated from college by the age of twenty-three. His father had even paved the way for Jeff
        to attend the same college from which he graduated, and had offered to pay Jeff's entire tuition and living expenses. As
        an active Alumni Association member, he was excited that his son would someday follow in his footsteps.<br/><br/>
        Jeff was twenty-seven and a successful business planner at a Fortune 500 company - without a degree. His passion
        was skiing. When he graduated from high school he decided to decline his father's offer and instead move to Colorado
        to work with a ski patrol. With pain in his eyes Jeff told me that he still remembered the day he told his father he was
        going to forego college and take a job at a ski resort. He remembered every word of the short conversation. He told his
        father of his passion for skiing and for the mountains and then of his plans. His father looked off into the distance, his
        face became red, and his eyes squinted and bore into Jeff. Then came the words that still echoed in Jeff's mind: "You
        lazy kid. No son of mine is going to work on a ski patrol and not attend college. I should have known you'd never
        amount to any thing. Don't come back in this house until you have enough self-respect to use the brains God gave you
        and go to school!"The two had not spoken since that conversation.<br/><br/>
        Jeff was not even sure that his father knew he was back in the area near where he grew up and he certainly did not
        want his father to know he was attending college. He was doing this for himself, he said over and over, not for his
        father.<br/><br/>
        Janice, Jeff's sister, had always remained supportive of Jeff's decisions. She stayed in contact with their father, but
        Jeff had made her promise that she would not share any information about his life with him. Jeff's graduation
        ceremony that year was on a hot, sunny day in June. As I walked around talking to people before the ceremony, I
        noticed a man with a confused expression on his face.<br/><br/>
        "Excuse me,"he said as he politely approached me. "What is happening here today?"<br/><br/>
        "It's graduation day," I replied, smiling.<br/><br/>
        "Well that's odd,"he said. "My daughter asked me to meet her at this address."His eyes sparkled and he smiled.<br/><br/>
        "Maybe she completed her Associate Professor and wanted to surprise me!"<br/><br/>
        I helped him find a seat and as he left me he said, "Thank you for helping me. By the way, my name's Dr. Holstrom."<br/><br/>
        I froze for a second. Jeff Holstrom. Dr. Holstrom. Could this be the same person I had heard about over the last year?<br/><br/>
        The cold, stern man who demanded his son attend college or never enter his home again?<br/><br/>
        Soon the familiar strains of "Pomp and Circumstance" could be heard. I turned around in my chair to get a glimpse
        of Dr. Holstrom. He seemed to be looking for his daughter amongst the graduates on stage. Speeches were given, the
        graduates were congratulated, and the dean began to read the names of the graduates.<br/><br/>
        Jeff was the last person to cross the stage. I heard his name being announced: "Jeff Holstrom, magna cum laude."<br/><br/>
        He crossed the stage, received his diploma from the college president, and, just as he started down the stairs from the
        stage, he turned toward the audience looking for his sister.<br/><br/>
        A lone figure stood up in the back of the audience - Dr. Holstrom. I'm not sure how Jeff even saw him in the crowd,
        but I could tell that heir eyes met. Dr. Holstrom opened his arms, as if to embrace the air around him. He bowed his
        head, almost as if to apologize. For a moment it seemed as if time stood still, and as if they were the only two in the
        auditorium. Jeff came down the stairs with tears in his eyes.<br/><br/>
        "My father is here,"he whispered to me. I smiled and then asked him:<br/><br/>
        "What are you going to do?"<br/><br/>
        "Well,"he said. "I think I'm going home."

        to help pay my tuition, there were only thirty seconds of the last exam of my college
        career. All I had to do now was traverse the campus to my car and drive home to start
        my new life - as a college graduate.<br/><br/>
        Well, maybe not. Halfway across campus, my heel broke. I continued limping and
        suddenly what was otherwise a sunny day began to cloud over. Was that a drop of rain I just felt on my cheek? What
        next?<br/><br/>
        By the time I reached my car, I was drenched. I was forty-five minutes late for margaritas. And there was a lot of
        traffic. I guess everyone else was in a hurry to get home and start their new lives too.<br/><br/>
        I negotiated the maze of parking lots for a long moment and drove to campus. One more traffic light to go. The
        light turned green but the car in front of me didn't move. The driver in that car began to honk. Then he swerved around
        whatever was blocking his path and sped off. I began to do the same when I realized that the obstruction was a young
        man in a wheelchair. In fact, I recognized him as one of my fellow classmates whom I had seen many times over the
        past four years, but never spoken to.<br/><br/>
        But I was in a hurry. I had important celebrating to do. So I decided to drive off. I glanced in my rear-view mirror
        and saw he struggling to get his chair out of the muddy intersection.<br/><br/>
        Surely someone else will help him, I thought.<br/><br/>
        But what if everyone else thought that, too?<br/><br/>
        I stopped.<br/><br/>
        His name was Jordan. His cerebral palsy affected his speech. I tried to get his wheelchair into my car but to no
        avail. If I was going to help him, it meant pushing him to wherever he was going, in the rain, in the mud. I like to think
        of myself as a nice person, but surely there were limits. After all, I did stop when no one else did. I did try to get his
        chair in my car. At least I got him out of the intersection.<br/><br/>
        As I was sorting through this dilemma, I looked down at Jordan. He was shivering in the rain. But he was smiling.<br/><br/>
        He didn't seem to mind. He clearly didn't expect me to do more than I had already done. He began to wheel off down
        the muddy sidewalk. I couldn't leave him now.<br/><br/>
        I locked my car and quickly caught up to him. I began to push. It was uphill for what seemed like a mile, and
        Jordan would crane his neck around with great effort so that he could look up at me in appreciation. How could I have
        even thought of leaving him? I thought.<br/><br/>
        At the end of our long trek to Jordan's apartment, which was the closest disabled person's accessible building to
        campus, both of us were drenched in sweat. I couldn't believe that Jordan had managed to do this alone, everyday for
        four years. To think I threw a tantrum every time I couldn't find a parking space close enough to my classes! Jordan
        insisted that I come in and dry off. He said there was someone he wanted me to meet.<br/><br/>
        I was a little afraid to go inside. I don't know what I expected. I hadn't ever been to a disabled person's home
        before. I guess I was afraid of the unknown. But when I got inside, I was a little ashamed of my fears. Not only was I
        surprised, I was impressed. Jordan's apartment didn't look like any ordinary college student's slovenly habitat.<br/><br/>
        Instead, it was a modicum of efficiency and good taste. Each item was carefully placed and within Jordan's reach. And
        so many books!<br/><br/>
        "Have you read all these?" I asked him.<br/><br/>
        "One a week for the last four years,"he replied.<br/><br/>
        That, in addition to his studies! He reached for my hand and motioned for me to follow him to the back bedroom.<br/><br/>
        He knocked gently and whispered something through the door. I followed him inside. He introduced me to his
        bedridden mother whom I later found out had suffered a stroke some years earlier. Chair-bound Jordan, full-time
        college student and avid reader was also her primary caretaker.<br/><br/>
        Jordan left us there and went to make some tea. I wasn't sure if his mother even knew that I was in the room or if
        she understood what Jordan had just told her about the chair and the rain. But suddenly she raised up her head and
        began to speak.<br/><br/>
        "In four years," she said, "not one person has ever helped my son. It's not that he needs help, but it gets lonely out
        there sometimes." I didn't know what to say. Margaritas seemed like such a distant thought now.<br/><br/>
        I stayed for dinner. Jordan and I celebrated our last day of school together. In all those classes and after all that
        studying, I learned my most valuable lesson`

        name: `Dare to take risks!`,
        title: `The greatest thing in this world is not so much where we are, but in what direction we
        are moving`,
        author: `Stephen Hopson`,
        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `e all have a very special purpose in life, regardless of who we are or where we come
        from. I truly believe each of us has a special calling in life even though it took me
        over thirty years to find mine!<br/><br/>
        Looking back, I realize my parents unwittingly shaped me to be the person I
        am today. For example, adopting my mother's streak of independence gave me the room I needed to take daring risks
        later in life. After ten years of working for a major Wall Street bank and slamming into a brick wall, I vehemently
        shouted "Enough!" I knew in my heart I could produce more outstanding results.<br/><br/>
        One day I was scanning through the papers in search of new and challenging Wall Street opportunities. My eyes
        were immediately drawn to a Merrill Lynch advertisement. They were looking to hire more stockbrokers, and the
        qualifications listed were clearly those that I possessed.<br/><br/>
        With great excitement, I made some phone calls and arranged to meet with one of the New Y ork City branch vice
        presidents. Unfortunately, on the day of my appointment, I was ghastly sick with a cold and 40-degree fever that
        threatened to topple me phy sically. Yet I knew a golden opportunity when I saw one and was determined to meet with
        the vice president. We ended up talking nonstop for three and a half hours!<br/><br/>
        Based on our conversation and the length of the interview, I was surprised and disappointed when, instead of
        making me an offer on the spot, he instructed me to meet with twelve of his top stockbrokers for further interviews.<br/><br/>
        Well, maybe that is a good sign, I thought.<br/><br/>
        Over the next five months, I met with these twelve people, each of whom invariably tried to discourage me by
        saying, "Y ou are better off in a safe nine-to-five bank job," "Y ou won't make it," "Eighty percent of newcomers fail within
        their first year" and "Y ou have no investment experience."Deepdown, I felt like a scared dog with its tail between its
        legs, but I didn't let it show.<br/><br/>
        The final interview was scheduled on a cold, blustery winter day. Five minutes into the interview, it was obvious
        the vice president did not know what to do with me. Apparently, it did not matter that I had written a well-researched
        twenty-five-page marketing plan that exceeded his expectations. And it did not matter that his top salespeople were
        impressed with me.<br/><br/>
        In a moment of daring risk and courage that forever changed my future, I looked at him straight in the eye and
        said, "Sir, if you don't hire me, you'll never know how well I can do for this firm."<br/><br/>
        When I realized what I had just said to him, a chill went up my spine and I thought, My God what have I done? But
        the next thing he said was like music to me: "Okay, you've got the job!"But before I could shake his hand and rush home
        to spread the good news, he added:"... on one condition.”<br/><br/>
        My heart seemed to stop. "Y ou must first resign from the bank effective two weeks from today, enroll in our threemonth training program and then take a stockbroker exam which must be passed on the first try. If you fail even by
        one point, you're out!"<br/><br/>
        I shook like a leaf. My mouth suddenly went dry. There was never a time in my life when I so desperately needed a
        glass of water! I remember thinking that I stood to lose every thing if I failed that exam, which I had heard was as
        difficult as the examination for attorney s. I swallowed hard and croaked, "I'll take it."My future was instantly changed
        from that moment forward!<br/><br/>
        After passing the exam and receiving my stockbroker's license, I struggled for several months, living solely on
        commission and eating pasta, peanut butter sandwiches and cereal. Night after night, I burned the midnight oil in
        search of new clients. I often left the office weary and fatigued, ready to give up, yet somehow returning the next
        morning to start a new day. It was a gruelling beginning during which I had no social life.<br/><br/>
        One of the most difficult and challenging aspects of being a stockbroker was making the largely dreaded "cold
        calls."We were required to make phone calls to literally hundreds of prospects each day, many of whom had never
        heard of us, in an effort to solicit new business. Rejection was a way of life, and I learned not to take it personally. It
        was all a numbers game. The more people I called, the more accounts I opened. In addition to cold calling, I also had
        to coddle very nervous clients. This was no easy feat!<br/><br/>
        Eventually, all the hard work paid off. In less than four years, I became one of the top salespeople at my branch
        and increased personal sales by 1,7 00 percent. Through continued faith and persistence, I built and managed
        multimillion-dollar investment portfolios for U.S. clients. This resulted in a cover-story for Careers and the disabled
        Magazine, on CNN and in numerous newspapers, including the New Y ork Times. All this success earned me a high
        income, a spot in the prestigious Merrill Lynch Executive Club, and numerous sales awards.<br/><br/>
        Toward the end of my fourth year at Merrill Lynch, I became spiritually bankrupt and depressed. I thought long
        and hard about my goals and where to go next.<br/><br/>
        I pleaded with God and asked to be led in the right direction. The Source reminded me of the time when I spoke to
        hundreds of people, while in college as a student leader, and years later, when I won a "Humorous Speech"
        championship. It dawned on me that every time I had a speaking engagement, I always came out of the experience
        with a wonderful, energetic, peaceful and magical feeling that was unmatched by any thing else I ever did. I
        instinctively knew God had blessed me with public-speaking skills that could enable me to make a difference and
        transform other people's lives.<br/><br/>
        After considering my options, I took another daring risk, gave up every thing and left the lucrative investment
        business for a more satisfying career as a motivational speaker. A lot of people, including my parents, thought I was
        crazy. "It is a pie-in-the-sky dream, because it isn't realistic," they said. I paid no attention to those words, and to this
        day I have never looked back.<br/><br/>
        The beginning of my speaking journey was eerily similar to what I had first experienced at Merrill Lynch. Once
        again, I went back to dining on pasta, peanut butter sandwiches and cereal. There were times when I had only a few
        dollars in my pocket and ate once a day. If everyone did this, it would put the diet industry out of business! To save
        money, instead of taking the subway to different parts of the city, I walked or rode my bike. Cab drivers were losing
        money because of me. Meanwhile, to keep my dream burning, I worked hard on creating a personal message that
        would reflect my experiences in the world of finance and inspire people to be the best they could be.<br/><br/>
        Nothing in the world comes close to the satisfying feeling I get when thousands of people tell me how much I have
        made a difference in their lives by motivating them to take risks and to make necessary changes.<br/><br/>
        The core of my message is, "If I can do it, you can, too!" What could be more satisfying than that? And I say that
        because I have been deaf since birth!

        contentEn: `Jennifer would have caught my attention even if she hadn't stopped to talk that afternoon. The
        first couple of weeks in my writing class are always a bit unsettling. The students are a blur of
        unfamiliar faces, most of them freshmen trying to acclimate themselves to their new
        environment. When Jennifer approached me with a question after the second day, I was
        grateful for the chance to know at least one name with a face.<br/><br/>
        Jennifer’s writing wasn't perfect, but her effort was. She worked hard and pushed herself to excel. She was excited
        to learn, which made me enjoy teaching her. I didn't realize then how much she would also teach me.<br/><br/>
        One afternoon, Jennifer stopped by after class. She wasn't clarifying homework or asking a question about a paper
        I'd returned.<br/><br/>
        "I didn't go to school yesterday," she said quietly. "I was at the health center the whole day." I gave her a sideway s
        look, startled. "I'm fine now," she reassured me with confidence. Then she was gone.<br/><br/>
        Two nights later, Jennifer's father called to tell me that she would be missing a few classes. She had been
        hospitalized with meningitis. I heard from him again a few days later, and again after that. Jennifer's condition had
        worsened, he said, and it appeared she might not finish the semester at all.<br/><br/>
        Jenny remained hospitalized, ninety miles away from home. Her mother stayed by her side, camped out in the
        corner of a cramped hospital room, sleeping night after night on a chair.<br/><br/>
        Her grandparents and long-standing friends all made their pilgrimages to the hospital room. Jenny's condition
        grew worse, not better. I was terrified when I saw the pale, emaciated girl who had only ten days earlier radiated life
        and warmth in my classroom. When her grandparents arrived, she announced proudly, in a tiny voice: "This is my
        college writing teacher." I remembered what her father had said in his first phone call: "School means every thing to
        Jenny."<br/><br/>
        A week later, Jenny herself called me to tell me she was on the road to recovery. "I'll be back," she insisted. "I have
        no doubt," I told her, choking back tears. But around the same time, news reports announced the meningitisinduced
        death of another student at another school. Jenny sank back into her hospital bed.<br/><br/>
        Then, five weeks later, I walked into my classroom to find Jenny in her seat, smiling as she talked to the students
        around her. I caught my breath as her thin body approached my desk, and she handed over all of her missed
        assignments, completed with thought and excellence. The strength of her will to overcome shone out of her pale, weak,
        eighteen-year-old face. It would be a few more days, though, before I learned the rest of the story.<br/><br/>
        Jenny's suitemates, Maren and Kate, were just getting up the Sunday morning to see Jenny dragging herself into
        the bathroom they shared. She had a horrendous headache and had been throwing up all night. Forty-five minutes
        later, as the two were leaving for church, she was still there. Maren had a bad feeling about Jenny and asked her
        Sundayschool class to pray for her. When they returned to the dorm three hours later, Jenny was still violently ill.
        Concerned that she was becoming dehydrated, they decided to take her to the emergency room.<br/><br/>
        The two girls lifted Jenny up and carried her out to the car, then from the car to the hospital. They spent the next
        seven hours at their friend's side, tracking down her parents, responding to doctors and trying to comfort a very sick
        eighteen-year-old through my riad medical tests. They left the hospital when Jenny's parents arrived but were back the
        next morning when the doctors confirmed that the meningitis was bacterial. By noon, they had the whole twohundredmember campus Christian group praying for Jenny.<br/><br/>
        I credit these two young students with the miracle of Jenny's life. I remember being asked as a college freshman
        who I considered a hero. I didn't have an answer then. Since that time, I've learned that I may have been looking for
        heroes in the wrong places. Ask me now who I admire, and I'll tell you about this couple of ordinary college students.

        For three days straight, the snow swirled and billowed, burying the isolated campus.<br/><br/>
        Here and there stray groups of students struggled single file against the weather, like
        ducklings following their mother across a road. The female students in dormitory B were
        confronted with the same problem plaguing the general population of the university.<br/><br/>
        "How are we going to get to the cafeteria?" asked one.<br/><br/>
        "We're not," answered another. "Every thing out there is white. We can't see any thing."<br/><br/>
        A gleam came into the eye of the third girl. She shushed the others' whining, saying triumphantly, "Emma could do
        it."<br/><br/>
        The whining turned to murmurs of excitement. "Emma!" "She even manages through the city." "We could follow
        her." "Y ou're a genius!"<br/><br/>
        The girls whooped, yelled and clapped for joy. They bundled up and excitedly trooped to Emma's room. They
        found Emma in the hallway and cornered her before she could even open her door.<br/><br/>
        "What's all the excitement?" she asked, smiling.<br/><br/>
        "Can we follow you to the cafeteria? We're blind in this storm.<br/><br/>

        "I suppose so. I'll go first, and you could hold on to each other's shoulders."<br/><br/>
        "Can we go now?"one girl begged. "I'm starving."<br/><br/>
        Emma smiled again. "Sure, let me just get Missy ready."<br/><br/>
        She went into her room and returned moments later with a dog.<br/><br/>
        The girls lined up obediently at the front door, ready to face the cold. They each placed their hands on the
        shoulders of the girl in front of them. Emma opened the door to lead them out. "I guess," she smiled, "you could call this
        the blind leading the seeing."And with that, Emma and her seeing-ey e dog, Missy, led her troop of hungry ducks to the
        cafeteria.

        contentEn: `hen Dr. Gullickson was assigning project mates for his introduction to experimental
        psy chology class, I secretly hoped he would pair me with a cute coed or at least a
        classmate I could have some fun with. Above all, I hoped he wouldn't assign me to
        work with the fiercely competitive, singularly serious fellow. As fate would have it,
        Dr. Gullickson very deliberately matched everyone in class and announced that I
        would be working with the one person in class I wanted to avoid.<br/><br/>
        I went up to my partner and introduced myself. He looked at me as though I weren't there. I felt he treated me as
        though I would hold him back and probably cause his gradepoint average to take a nosedive. He wasn't outright mean
        or abusive. He just gave me the impression he could do whatever project we dreamed up better if he did it alone. He
        was a loner, and I could only impede his research. He had important things to do, and I was going to be something of
        an annoyance he'd have to deal with. Needless to say, I didn't look forward to an entire semester of being brushed off,
        but I tried to make the best of it and didn't say any thing, lest I make things worse.<br/><br/>
        The project required each team to develop a hypothesis, set up an experiment to test the hypothesis, do the
        statistical analy sis and present the findings. Whatever grade the team received would be shared by both students.<br/><br/>
        When we met to discuss our project, I felt very uneasy. Here was this haughty student who had a reputation for
        singlemindedness and good grades - the exact opposite of me. I was completely outmatched. I actually wanted to drop
        the class at one point, but stopped short because I didn't want to give him the satisfaction of my chickening out. I
        asked my friends at work what I should do, and the overall response was to stick it out no matter what.<br/><br/>
        After lengthy discussions, we somehow agreed to do a study on the perception of space. I wasn't sure what it
        meant, but at least we had a topic. We started to meet regularly to formulate our plans, and every time I felt the
        project was more his than mine. The more we met, the more I resented his intelligence and his ability to cut through to
        the core issues. And I was aware he was much more advanced than I. He knew technical things and approached every
        detail with great singularity of purpose.<br/><br/>
        I, on the other hand, must have seemed naive, with little to offer. At one point I summoned up my courage and
        asked him why he seemed so uptight and serious. To my surprise, he replied that he didn't have time for small talk or
        petty things that would waste his time. He even went on to say that he didn't have many friends because most so-called
        friends were just a distraction. But, he added, when he did choose someone to be his friend, they would be a friend for
        life. I was floored by his cold and cynical response.<br/><br/>
        We tried to fashion a simple yet elegant experiment. Part of our job was to select students who had volunteered to
        be subjects for our project. I decided to work with the subjects, while he developed the scientific model. I put in my
        ideas whenever I could, but I still felt he was the driving force.<br/><br/>
        Then one day I got word that he was in the hospital. Apparently, he had been admitted for a hemorrhaging ulcer.<br/><br/>
        The stress of getting the best grades, holding down a job and helping his girlfriend through the medical crisis she was
        going through had made him exhausted.<br/><br/>
        When I visited him in the hospital, I noticed for the first time a sense of vulnerability on the face of my partner. I
        knew that he thought that I could blow the experiment, and our shared grade would shatter his lofty G.P.A. and
        possibly derail his chances for graduate school. I assured him I would not let him down and he should only
        concentrate on getting better. I would do my best. We both knew I'd have to do better than my best.<br/><br/>
        I had a formidable task ahead of me. I poured more time and energy into that project than I had ever done on any
        assignment in my life. I was not going to let him see me fail and have it reflect on him. I was working the graveyard shift
        at my job, so I used whatever quiet time from midnight to 6:00 A.M. to work on the project. The work consumed me.<br/><br/>
        There was a sense of challenge that completely overtook me. The question remained: Was I up to it?<br/><br/>
        Eventually, the semester came to a close, and each team had to present its findings in front of the assembled class.<br/><br/>
        When it was our turn, I did my level best to present his scientific methodology with my showmanship. To my
        amazement, we were awarded an A!<br/><br/>
        When I told him about our shared triumph, he smiled and thanked me for carrying on. Something happened.<br/><br/>
        Something special. It had to do with trust and the exhilaration of sharing a common prize.<br/><br/>
        We have stayed close throughout the years. He went on to achieve a doctorate and marry his college girlfriend.<br/><br/>
        I learned more than statistical analy sis and experimental procedures that semester. My life has been enhanced by
        our encounter and challenged by this man, who became my unlikely hero.<br/><br/>
        And in the end, he was right: we have become friends for life`

        information will just work its way into my brain through osmosis. I was beginning
        to think that was my only hope for learning this material. I felt like I was on a
        different planet. How could this seem so foreign to me?<br/><br/>
        Of all the classes that I had taken so far in college, I could not make this one work. I couldn't even lay out a logical
        study plan. What now? I pondered, with my head down on my desk in the middle of class.<br/><br/>
        When I lifted my head off the page, unbeknownst to me, a Post-it Note had stuck to my bangs. There was a pretty

        Matt Starr was the literal "star"of the class. I was convinced he could teach it. And, as luck would have it, he was

        exchange for his help, I cleaned his apartment and brought over bribe treats: cookies, snacks, even dinner sometimes.<br/><br/>
        He was so smart and would get so involved in the material. He asked, "Don't you realize that this is the stuff that the
        universe is made of?"Not my universe. I told him that my universe was made up of child development and psy chology
        classes and an occasional shopping mall not equations like this. He would just laugh. He was convinced that he could
        get me to understand this material, and in a way he was right. He was so cry stal clear in his understanding that I could
        see it through his eyes.<br/><br/>
        Matt and I started spending more time together. We would take long walks, go to movies - when he wasn't forcing

        girl should know. When I brought home a B in calculus, we celebrated for three days.<br/><br/>
        Throughout college we were close friends. We dated, only briefly, but the chemistry we shared was more like that
        of a brother and sister. We did, however, help each other through our other various and odd relationships; and when it
        looked hopeless, like neither one of us would ever find a mate, we took the next logical step - we got a puppy. Having
        rescued it from the pound, we called this little dog Tucker. We had been spending so much time together that when I
        moved out of my dorm, Tucker, Matt and I became roommates.<br/><br/>
        The day Matt came home and told me he was sick, it was raining heavily. It rained that entire week as if the world
        was mirroring our tears. Matt had AIDS.<br/><br/>
        Two weeks later, he was in the hospital with pneumocy stis. The hows and the whys didn't matter when we were
        both spending every moment trying to get him better. Between taking final exams, figuring out medications, visiting
        healers and taking care of Matt, I was completely exhausted - but he was getting better.<br/><br/>
        Matt and I decided that we were going to make the time either one of us had left on this planet count. By the time
        we arrived at our senior year, I had lived life more fully than I had in all my twenty previous years. When we
        graduated, we all proudly wore our caps and gowns, Tucker included. Two months later, Matt went home to
        Minneapolis to live with his family.<br/><br/>
        Life continued; we e-mailed each other voraciously. I sent Matt tons of.jpg images of Tucker and his antics, and we
        went back and forth recounting stories of our lives.<br/><br/>
        Matt lived only two years more. When I got the news that he had been taken to the hospital, I flew out to be with
        him. By then, he had fallen into a coma from which he would never awaken. At the funeral, I artfully stuck a yellow
        Post-it Note to my hair and put one of Tucker's favorite chew toys in the casket.<br/><br/>
        One night, about a year after Matt's funeral, Tucker and I were driving in the hills of Mulholland. Suddenly, I
        smelled something so very familiar to me, and yet I couldn't place it. It was a lovely colognelike fragrance. Then
        Tucker began acting peculiar.<br/><br/>
        "What's the matter, boy, did you smell it, too? What is that smell? I just can't place it."<br/><br/>
        Stopped at a red light, I looked up at the night sky and Tucker barked. What I saw next amazed me. It was a
        shooting star. A star! Of course, Matt Starr! It was his cologne I smelled.<br/><br/>
        "Is he trying to say hello and tell us he's okay?"Tucker started wagging his tail furiously. Whether it was a sign or
        not, I felt the warmest and most secure feeling I've felt while thinking about Matt. The giant gaping void that was
        created when he left was suddenly filled with that warm love the two of us always shared. Matt wasn't gone, he was
        right here with me, as he always would be.<br/><br/>
        Suddenly, I understood how it all fit together. The universe, my friend and even his calculus`

        you can`,
        author: `David Coleman and Kevin Randall`,

        contentEn: `In the summer recess between freshman and sophomore years in college, I was invited to
        be an instructor at a high-school camp hosted by a college in Michigan. Because I was
        already highly involved in most extracurricular activities, I jumped at the opportunity.<br/><br/>
        About an hour into the first day of camp, I first noticed the boy under the tree. He was
        small and skinny, and his obvious discomfort and shyness made him appear frail and fragile. Only fifty feet away, two
        hundred eager campers were playing and joking, but this boyseemed not to want to be anywhere other than where he
        was. The loneliness he radiated almost stopped me from approaching him, but I remembered the instructions from the
        senior staff to stay alert for campers who might feel left out.<br/><br/>
        As I walked toward him, I said, "Hi, my name is Kevin, and I'm one of the counselors. It's nice to meet you." In a
        shaky, sheepish voice he reluctantly answered, "Okay, I guess." I asked him if he wanted to join the activities and meet
        some new people. He quietly replied, "No, this is not really my thing."<br/><br/>
        I could sense that he was in a strange world. But I somehow knew it wouldn't be right to push him, either. He didn't
        need a pep talk; he needed a friend. After several silent moments, our first interaction was over.<br/><br/>
        At lunch the next day, I found myself leading camp songs for two hundred of my new friends. The campers eagerly
        participated. I saw the image of the boy from under the tree, sitting alone, staring out the window. I nearly forgot the
        words to the song I was supposed to be leading. I tried again, with the same questions as before: "Are you okay?"To
        which he again replied, "Y eah, I'm all right. I just don't really get into this stuff."As I left the cafeteria, I realized this
        was going to take more time and effort than I had thought - if it was even possible to get through to him at all.<br/><br/>
        That evening at our nightly staff meeting, I made my concerns about him known. I explained to my fellow staff
        members my impression of him and asked them to pay special attention and spend time with him.<br/><br/>
        The days I spend at camp fly by faster than any others I have known. In the final night of camp, I was holding the
        "last dance."The students were doing all they could to savor every last moment with their new "best friends" - friends
        they would probably never see again.<br/><br/>
        As I watched the campers share their parting moments, I suddenly saw what would be one of the most vivid
        memories of my life. The boy from under the tree, who had stared blankly out the kitchen window, was now a
        wonderful dancer. He owned the dance floor as he and two girls proceeded to cut a rug. He shared meaningful, intimate
        time with people at whom he couldn't even look just days earlier. I couldn't believe it was the same person.<br/><br/>
        In October of my sophomore year, I received a late-night phone call. A soft-spoken, unfamiliar voice asked
        politely, "Is Kevin there?"<br/><br/>
        "Y ou're talking to him. Who's this?"<br/><br/>
        "This is Tom Johnson's mom. Do you remember Tommy from camp?"<br/><br/>
        The boy under the tree. How could I not remember?<br/><br/>
        "Yes, I do," I said. "He's a very nice young man. How is he?"<br/><br/>
        An long pause followed, then Mrs. Johnson said, "My Tommy was walking home from school this week when he
        was hit by a car and killed." I was really shocked, and I offered my condolences.<br/><br/>
        "I just wanted to call you," she said, "because Tommy mentioned you so many times. I wanted you to know that he
        went back to school this fall with confidence. He made new friends. His grades went up. And he even went out on a few
        dates. I just wanted to thank you for making a difference for Tom. The last few months were the best few months of his
        life."<br/><br/>
        In that instant, I realized how easy it is to give a bit of yourself everyday. You may never know how much each
        gesture may mean to someone else. I tell this story as often as I can, and when I do, I urge others to look out for their
        own "boy under the tree."`

        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `I was a freshman in college when I met the Whites. They were completely different from my
        own family, yet I felt at home with them instantly. Jane White and I became friends at
        school, and her family welcomed me like a long-lost cousin.<br/><br/>
        In my family, when any thing bad happened, it was always important to place blame.<br/><br/>
        "Who did this?"my mother would yell about a mess in the kitchen.<br/><br/>
        "This is all your fault, Katharine,"my father would insist when the dishwasher broke.<br/><br/>
        From the time we were little, my sister and brothers and I told on each other. We set a place for Blame at the
        dinner table.<br/><br/>
        But the Whites didn't worry about who had done what. They picked up the pieces and moved on with their lives.<br/><br/>
        The beauty of this was driven home to me the summer that Jane died.<br/><br/>
        Mr. and Mrs. White had six children: three sons and three daughters. One son had passed away in childhood,
        which may be why the surviving five siblings remained so close.<br/><br/>
        In July, the White sisters and I decided to take a car trip from their home in Florida to New Y ork. The two oldest,
        Sarah and Jane, were college students, and the youngest, Amy, had recently turned sixteen. The possessor of a brandnew driver's license, Amy was excited about practicing her driving on the trip. With her endearing giggle, she showed
        off her license to everyone she met.<br/><br/>
        The big sisters shared the driving of Sarah's new car during the first part of the trip, but when they reached less
        populated areas, they let Amy take over. She came to an intersection with a stop sign. Whether she was careless or
        distracted or just didn't see the sign no one will ever know, but Amy continued into the intersection without stopping.<br/><br/>
        The driver of a large lorry, unable to brake in time, plowed into our vehicle.<br/><br/>
        Jane was killed instantly.<br/><br/>
        I luckily survived the accident with only a few bruises. The most difficult thing that I've ever done was to call the
        Whites to tell them about the accident and that Jane had died. As painful as it was for me to lose a good friend, I knew
        that it was far worse for them to lose a child.<br/><br/>
        When Mr. and Mrs. White arrived at the hospital, they found their two surviving daughters sharing a room. Sarah's
        head was wrapped in bandages; Amy's leg was in a cast. They hugged us all and cried. Those were tears of sadness and
        of joy at seeing their daughters. They wiped away the girls'tears and teased a few giggles out of Amy as she learned to
        use her crutches.<br/><br/>
        To both of their daughters, and especially to Amy, over and over they simply said, "We're so glad that you're
        alive."<br/><br/>
        I was astonished. No accusations. No blame.<br/><br/>
        Later, I asked the Whites why they never talked about the fact that Amy was driving and had run a stop sign.<br/><br/>
        Mrs. White said, "Jane's gone, and we miss her terribly. Nothing we say or do will bring her back. But Amy has her
        whole life ahead of her. How can she lead a full and happy life if she feels we blame her for her sister's death?"<br/><br/>
        They were right. Amy graduated from college and got married several years ago. She works as a teacher of
        learning-disabled students. She's also a mother of two little girls of her own, the oldest named Jane.<br/><br/>
        I learned from the Whites that blame really isn't very important. Sometimes, there's no use for it at all.`

        contentEn: `The day I met Hani Irmawati, she was a shy, seventeen year-old girl standing alone in
        the parking lot of the international school in Indonesia, where I teach English. The
        school is expensive and does not permit Indonesian students to enroll. She walked
        up to me and entreat me to teach her English. I could tell it took immense courage
        for the young Indonesian girl in worn clothing to approach me and ask for my help.<br/><br/>
        "Why do you want to improve your English?" I asked her, fully expecting her to talk about finding a job in a local
        hotel.<br/><br/>
        "I want to go to an American university," she said with quiet confidence. Her idealistic dream made me want to
        cry.<br/><br/>
        I agreed to work with her after school each day on a volunteer basis. For the next several months, Hani woke each
        morning at five and caught the city bus to her public high school. During the one-hour ride, she studied for her regular
        classes and prepared the English lessons I had given her the day before. At four o'clock in the afternoon, she arrived at
        my classroom, exhausted but ready to work. With each passing day, as Hani struggled with college-level English, I
        grew more fond of her. She worked harder than most of my wealthy expatriate students.<br/><br/>
        Hani lived in a two-room house with her parents and two brothers. Her father was a building custodian and her
        mother was a maid. When I went to their neighborhood to meet them, I learned that their combined yearly income
        was 7 50 U.S. dollars. It wasn't enough to meet the expenses of even one month in an American university. Hani's
        enthusiasm was increasing with her language ability, but I was becoming more and more discouraged.<br/><br/>
        One morning in December 1998, I received the announcement of a scholarship opportunity for a major American
        university. I excitedly tore open the envelope and studied the requirements, but it wasn't long before I dropped the
        form in despair. There was just no way, I thought, for Hani to meet these qualifications. She had never led a club or an
        organization, because in her school these things simply did not exist. She had no guidance counselor and no
        impressive standardized test scores, because there were no such tests for her to take.<br/><br/>
        She did, however, have more determination than any student I'd ever seen. When Hani came into the classroom
        that day, I told her of the scholarship. I also told her that I believed there was no way for her to apply. I encouraged
        her to be, as I put it, "realistic" about her future and not to plan so strongly on coming to America. Even after my
        somber lecture, Hani remained steadfast.<br/><br/>
        "Will you send in my name?" she asked. I didn't have the heart to turn her down. When I completed the
        application, I had to fill in each blank with the truth about her academic life, but also with my praise of her courage and
        her perseverance. I sealed up the envelope and told Hani her chances for acceptance ranged somewhere between slim
        and none.<br/><br/>
        In the weeks that followed, Hani increased her study of English, and I arranged for her to take the Test of English
        Fluency in Jakarta. The entire computerized test would be an enormous challenge for someone who had never before
        touched a computer. For two weeks, we studied computer parts and how they worked. Then, just before Hani went to
        Jakarta, she received a letter from the scholarship association. What a cruel time for the rejection to arrive, I thought.<br/><br/>
        trying to prepare her for disappointment, I opened the letter and began to read it to her. I couldn't believe it! She had
        been accepted.<br/><br/>
        I leaped about the room ecstatically, shocked. Hani stood by, smiling quietly, but almost certainly bewildered by
        my surprise. The image of her face in that moment came back to me time and time again in the following week. I finally
        realized that it was I who had learned something Hani had known from the beginning: It is not intelligence alone that
        brings success, but also the commitment to work hard and the courage to believe in yourself`

        in the spring of 1993. My father worked there with a group inmates to help them improve
        their communication skills. I was a senior in college, majoring in speech
        communications, and I started my own volunteer student group at Gander Hill.<br/><br/>
        Teaching communication means getting people to tell their stories, but Ray could tell
        you how much he missed his guitar without speaking. Sometimes he moved his hands across the air as if he were
        playing his favorite melody. He always gave me a slight nod when he saw me come into the chapel for the meeting. He
        loved sharing his guitar stories. Although he had been an inmate at Gander Hill for over a decade, he always had a song
        in his head, in particular one that he said he had been writing in his mind since his arrival. He looked forward to
        playing again the way a child eagerly counts the days until summer vacation.<br/><br/>

        huddled with their loved ones, whom they had not seen or touched in several months. Since his family lived in Texas,
        no one came to the celebration, but he waited patiently for me to arrive. As he rehearsed his song in his head, I walked
        into the prison with a guitar.<br/><br/>
        Ray tuned that guitar as if he were putting his life back into harmony. He looked at me over his shoulder and

        contentEn: `On homecoming day my senior year of college, I was in the stands, surrounded by
        my fraternity brothers and watching my school, the University of Mississippi, play
        against Vanderbilt. The game was scoreless late in the first quarter, and Ole Miss
        had their backs to the goal line. I happened to be sitting parallel to the play action.<br/><br/>
        The Vanderbilt quarterback drew back and passed to the tailback for what looked to
        be a sure touch-down.<br/><br/>
        All of a sudden, an Ole Miss defender -football jersey #38, named Chucky Mullins -read the play perfectly and
        charged the Vanderbilt receiver, hitting him first and jarring the ball from his hands. As I stood up and cheered for the
        touchdown-saving play, I noticed everyone got up from the ground but #38, who lay where he had fallen.<br/><br/>
        The Ole Miss trainer ran out onto the field, knelt beside Chucky and asked him what the problem was. "I cannot feel
        any thing, anywhere," replied Chucky.<br/><br/>
        The emergency medical team immobilized him on a spine board and took him to the small community hospital in
        Oxford. Once the doctors X-rayed him, they saw the catastrophic damage that had been done to his spine. He was
        immediately flown to the neurosurgery intensive care unit at Baptist Memorial Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, eighty
        miles away. His status: paraly zed from the neck down and fighting for his life.<br/><br/>
        The force with which Mullins had hit that Vanderbilt receiver had caused four vertebrae in his spine to fracture
        explosively. The neurosurgeon who operated on Chucky said it was the worst such injury he had ever seen. The
        surgery to realign Mullins' spine, although successful left him paraly zed from the neck down without the possibility of a
        return of function.<br/><br/>
        Chucky, a sophomore, vowed not only to walk again, but to return to Ole Miss for his degree. Ole Miss officials
        quickly established a Chucky Mullins Trust Fund and invited contributions from students, alumni and other
        universities to help meet the phenomenal medical costs, estimated at ten thousand dollars per week.<br/><br/>
        The following Saturday, Ole Miss was to play Louisiana State University. The student body decided to take up a
        collection for the Chucky Mullins Trust Fund at that game. So many students signed up that hundreds had to be turned
        away. The students waded through the stands carrying buckets or trash bags, and collected donations in excess of
        \$17 5,000.<br/><br/>
        Chucky, allowed to sit up in bed and listen to the game on the radio, was stunned to hear the announcers describe
        the outpouring of affection for him. The story was soon being told all over America. Money arrived from every state in
        the nation. Within a few months, the donations had reached close to a million dollars.<br/><br/>
        Later that year, the university was preparing to elect its "Colonel Rebel,"which is the school's highest accolade.
        Seven students were in the running. All withdrew their candidacies by writing a joint letter to the dean saying that it
        was their hope that all students would show their support by voting for Chucky Mullins. Chucky, a poor African
        American from Alabama, was named Colonel Rebel that year. It is important to keep in mind that this is the same
        school where federal troops were once needed to protect a single black student who wanted to enroll.<br/><br/>
        The Ole Miss football team completed the season by defeating arch-rival Mississippi State and gaining an
        invitation to the Liberty Bowl. Miraculously, only a few months after the devastating injury, Chucky attended the
        Liberty Bowl game, bound to his wheelchair. Moments before the game, as the players crowded around him, all
        wearing #38 on the sides of their helmets, he nodded to them and whispered, "It's time."Ole Miss defeated the Air
        Force Academy that night 42 to 29, becoming Liberty Bowl Champions.<br/><br/>
        In January, against all odds, Chucky returned to classes at Ole Miss. Although some would call it his greatest
        achievement, his goal was to eventually get up and walk out of his wheelchair. He would tell reporters, "I know what
        the doctors say, but I will never quit trying."<br/><br/>
        Wednesday, May 1, 1991, Chucky was getting ready for class when he suddenly stopped breathing. A blood clot
        shut down his lungs. He never regained consciousness and died five days later.<br/><br/>
        All of the Ole Miss football team members were present at the funeral, where he was laid to rest by his mother.<br/><br/>
        Afterward, some people would say that it might have been better if he had died right away and been spared the
        suffering. Obviously, they did not understand. Chucky, who came to the University of Mississippi as a poor kid with
        nothing, changed his world forever.`

        Lynn. She had really inspired me. I wanted to help people, to make a difference in
        their lives, just like she was doing.<br/><br/>
        I knew I had work to do because I hadn't really applied myself in high school.<br/><br/>
        It was more social for me than any thing else. But I knew that if I really wanted to do this, I was going to need help. So, I
        made an appointment to see a guidance counselor, Mr. Shaw.<br/><br/>
        He listened to my inspired rap as I went on and on about the wonders of a helping career. I could actually help
        make a difference in the world! Mr. Shaw looked back at me in disbelief. "Y ou're not college material,"he said clearly
        and deliberately. It felt like my heart stopped in the moment of those icy words.<br/><br/>
        That evening I broke the news to my parents. Seeing how distraught I was, and how sincere I was in really wanting
        to go to college, they offered to help. They found a small college that would take me if I could manage to get a C
        average out of the current semester. It was too late. I had goofed around too much, and even my best efforts could not
        bring up my gradepoint average.<br/><br/>
        I felt like such a loser. Mr. Shaw's resounding words came back to me: "Y ou're not college material."And I was
        beginning to believe it. So much so that I was flunking outeven at this college.<br/><br/>
        I gave up. I believed Mr. Shaw was right about me. After I left college, I moved home again and starting working
        part-time jobs. Maybe college wasn't for me. But deep down in my heart I knew that I truly wanted to be a teacher or
        social worker, and... that would require a college degree.<br/><br/>
        What would I do? I simply had to try again, I had to believe in myself even if no one else did. With all the courage I
        could muster, I enrolled in a community college nearby and took one course in their night school. I was shocked when
        I received my grade. I got an A. Maybe it was a mistake or some sort of fluke. I took another course and earned
        another A.<br/><br/>
        I made an appointment to see one of my professors. Things were turning around, and I needed guidance. Dr. Sarah
        Cohen, my professor in child psy chology, told me to relax and enjoy my experience; I was doing very well. She also
        said that I was fun, bright and could do any thing I want to. Here was an educational expert with a different message. I
        felt empowered. I was on my way.<br/><br/>
        I graduated from that community college with honors and went on to earn my B.A. in psy chology and my M.A. in
        psy chology from New Y ork University. The very same degree Mr. Shaw holds.<br/><br/>
        I realized that choosing who you believe in can change your life. When I believed Mr. Shaw, my life fell apart and
        there was no way I would ever realize my dream. But when I believed in myself and persevered through seemingly
        insurmountable odds, I encountered more people who inspired and supported me the way Dr. Cohen had.<br/><br/>

        myself`,
        author: `Eric Saperston`,

        contentEn: `I couldn't believe it. As I walked onto campus I saw posters everywhere with the words
        "Zap the Sap!" scrawled on them. I was the student body president. As my peers began
        arriving on campus, I watched them gather around the posters and then look my way.<br/><br/>
        At that moment, I felt my heart, my whole body was being pushed back and forth over a
        cheesegrater. I was in pieces and trying desperately to keep my composure.<br/><br/>
        When I was elected student body president, campus officials congratulated me on my campaign saying it was one
        of the best the college had seen. My "political career"began by throwing Frisbees on the campus lawn. I would throw a
        Frisbee to someone I didn't know and they would throw it to someone they didn't know. Before long, we had built a
        community of people who met everyday at lunch to throw Frisbees.<br/><br/>
        One day while throwing Frisbees, the group spontaneously decided to climb the mountain near our campus. When
        we reached the summit, it felt like we were at summer camp. We laughed, danced and told stories. It was intoxicatingly
        fun. While playing like little children in the cool air, we unanimously decided to do it again the following week. Our
        motto was "Bring a Friend."<br/><br/>
        So the next week while playing Frisbee, we would throw it to someone we didn't know, run over and invite them to
        climb the mountain with us. We started out with a small group. But as the word spread, the number of participants
        increased.<br/><br/>
        One day on campus, I met a girl in a wheelchair and we started talking. Her name was Grace. I asked her if she had
        ever been to the top of the mountain. She said she hadn't. I told her that my buddies and I would carry her if she were
        up for it. Grace accepted the offer. The next time we went up the mountain, we all took turns grabbing a corner of her
        chair as we carried her 1.7 miles to the top.<br/><br/>
        This was probably one of the most magical and deeply meaningful things I did in college. By the end, we had over
        seventy five people climbing the mountain on Thursdays, including Grace. All of us who participated felt like we were
        part of something much bigger than we were. We were building a community and it felt great.<br/><br/>
        With the student body elections approaching, my friends from the mountain encouraged me to run for president.<br/><br/>
        So I did. I knew I could make a difference. With a campaign team of seventy-five people, no one was surprised that I
        had won the election.<br/><br/>
        The first thing I did as president was hang a sign outside the Associated Students office that read, "Under New
        Management!" I was proud of my accomplishment. This was one of the few times I had actually achieved bona fide
        respect and appreciation from my peers.<br/><br/>
        People say absolute power corrupts absolutely. It sure did in my case. I let all the power go to my head. My ego,
        my arrogance and my pride were out of control. I began speaking down to people, demanding they listen to me
        because I thought I knew what was best. My friends and supporters tried to communicate to me that I had changed,
        that I was abusing my position, but I wasn't listening.<br/><br/>
        It wasn't long before the very people who had believed in my presidency began to turn against me. But I still
        wasn't paying attention. I took my obsession with power to such an extreme. A public conflict with the female vice
        president opened the floodgates for others who were upset with me. What started out as a wonderful experience, or so
        I thought, suddenly turned into one of my worst nightmares. "Zap the Sap!"posters would soon be everywhere on
        campus.<br/><br/>
        When I realized I had made a mistake, it was too late. My whole world collapsed. I had never felt so much pain and
        sadness in my life as I did then. There I was, one of the mostliked guys and powerful, until my ego destroyed
        every thing. A friend of mine said, "When a man looks into the abyss and nothing is staring back, that is when he finds
        his true character." I was empty and emotionally bankrupt. I was at the bottom and had nowhere else to go but up. I
        began to rebuild. I apologized to a couple of die-hard supporters, who for whatever reason did not quit on me, and
        asked them to forgive me for all the wrongdoing I had committed. They accepted. I told them I was going to fight this
        recall election. I wasn't just going to roll over and accept defeat.<br/><br/>
        The campus was in an uproar. Everyday the newspaper had an article saying what a big jerk I was. So I went back
        out to the campus lawn and began explaining to the students that the allegations were true. I had let the power get to
        my head and abused my position. I said that I had learned my lesson and that I was not done serving the students. I
        wanted to build a coffeehouse on the campus, only the second of its kind in the state. I thought to myself, please do not
        recall me. I am not done yet.<br/><br/>
        I am not sure if I would have been recalled or not, but when summer came, the charges were dropped and I stayed
        in office.<br/><br/>
        The next semester, I had a chance to begin again. As I approached my mission to build the coffeehouse, I was
        much more humble. I wanted to show the campus and myself that I was worthy of my position. I had never built a
        coffeehouse before and didn't really know what to do, so I asked everyone for help. I asked the students, my advisor,
        the governing board and the college president.<br/><br/>
        I used to think that I had to pretend to know what I was doing, that I had every thing under control and that I was
        in charge. It was that kind of thinking that got me into trouble. Now, I was finding that the easiest way to gain other
        people's respect was to admit to them what I did not know. It was my my humility, and my willingness to ask others for
        help that was making me win in my new endeavor.<br/><br/>
        I finished my term as president. In the end, the team that I had put together raised over \$125,000 and we built a
        coffeehouse that is still there eleven years later.<br/><br/>
        On graduation day, as I grabbed my diploma and walked past my college president, he whispered, "What doesn't
        kill you makes you stronger."`

        contentEn: `I met Eileen, my brother's wife, when I was seven years old. Only she wasn't his wife then.<br/><br/>
        She was a lovable nineteen-year old with blond hair! I loved her immediately. She was
        beautiful and funny and terrified of my parents when she came over for dinner the first
        time.<br/><br/>
        This was back in the days of formal meals with lots of forks lined up. Eileen dropped two peas in her lap, then two
        more and then another one. She thought nobody saw. I watched her wrap them up in her napkin discreetly. After
        dinner I told her, "I saw the peas." I said I wouldn't tell, though. Thirty-one years have passed, and this is the first time
        I've said any thing to anybody. It's okay - she said I could.<br/><br/>
        We were talking on the phone the other day, right around her fiftieth birthday. She was trying to describe what
        fifty felt like. She said she didn't feel like the mature one. She said that my sisters and I had passed her a long time ago.<br/><br/>
        There were times she felt left out.<br/><br/>
        For my sisters and me, it was the natural order of things: high school, college, grad school. But Eileen worked
        while my brother went through medical school. Then she had babies. She chose to be a full-time mother at a time when
        many women chose careers first. I never saw a person who loved babies so much. I never saw a happier mom.<br/><br/>
        "And you never knew how I ached,"Eileen said.<br/><br/>
        No, I didn't.<br/><br/>
        She told me about a ring - the college ring she had gotten right before she had dropped out. She wore it for years
        but decided one day to take it off.<br/><br/>
        "A woman at the library recognized it and said she had gone to the same school"Eileen explained. "And so she
        asked when I graduated. And I said, 'Well actually I didn't.' And she said, 'Well then why are you wearing that ring?' And
        I thought: This woman is right. I am a phony. I am pretending to be someone I am not."<br/><br/>
        I never knew this college thing was such a huge deal to her. She used to tease my sisters about "getting to the other
        side."And by the time I got there, she was joking about being abandoned. I laughed right along with her, never
        realizing.<br/><br/>
        Now I do. I've been out of school long enough to chase other dreams. I understand what it is to have an unfulfilled
        promise to yourself. It can seem so tiny to everyone else as to be imperceptible. But so can a grain of sand in your eye.<br/><br/>
        In lieu of the college ring, Eileen took to wearing her daughter's high-school ring. "I was so proud of Aly son for
        graduating high school," she said.<br/><br/>
        Aly son is now in college, studying art. Her younger brother John finished college in two and a half years. Joe, the
        third child, is a star student in high school. Tom, the youngest, is in the eighth grade. Eileen has always paid special
        attention to Tom's schooling. For a while there, it seemed as if Eileen and Tom were always doing homework together.<br/><br/>
        Now she tells me: "I thought I was going to have a nervous breakdown. I was everybody else but me. I lived
        through my husband. I lived through my kids. I wanted to have control of everybody. I wanted them to live my
        dream".<br/><br/>
        "And so I was hell-bent that my kids were going to go to college. They were never going to feel inadequate, the way
        I did. And that was so wrong. I had to get my own life."<br/><br/>
        So a year ago, she signed up for two English courses at the college she had left eighteen years before. The first day
        of class, she put the ring back on. She got books and test dates. She thought, There is no way I can do this.<br/><br/>
        Well, she got an A and a B-plus in those courses. She signed up for four courses over the summer. Then the
        following semester, just last September, she signed up for five courses and committed herself to write her senior thesis
        on Charles Dickens.<br/><br/>
        She aced all five classes. She aced her thesis. She is about to graduate, at fifty, this spring. She told me she hasn't
        been this happy since she was nineteen, and she said the happiness is only about the college degree.<br/><br/>
        She told me about Joe and John cooking dinner for the family while she was off at class. She told me about Aly son
        cleaning the house so her mom could study. She told me about my brother tutoring her in chemistry. She told me who
        volunteered to read her thesis: Tom.<br/><br/>
        It was because of her family, not despite it, that she was able to make it. And this circle of give-and-take had made
        fifty the greatest age to be.`

        Just consider the last hundred years. At the beginning of the century the progressives made it the law of the land
        for every child to be in school. Before then there was no such requirement. After World War II, we said ten years are
        not enough, public schools should extend to twelve years. And then the G.I. Bill and college loans threw open the

        America knows that higher education is the key to the growth we need to lift our country, and today that is more
        true than ever. Over half the new jobs created in the last three years have been managerial and professional jobs. The
        new jobs require a higher level of skills.<br/><br/>
        Fifteen years ago the typical worker with a college degree made 38 percent more than a worker with a high-school
        diploma. Today that figure is 7 3 percent more. Two years of college means a 20 percent increase in annual earnings.
        People who finish two years of college earn a quarter of a million dollars more than their high-school counterparts

        or, "If only I had made just a little more money."But we will think about the dreams we lived out, the wonders we knew,

        contentEn: `Greenbriar Valley lay almost hidden by the lowhanging clouds that spilled
        intermittent showers. As I plodded through the muddy barnyard preparing to do
        my chores, I glanced at the road that led past our place and wound on through the
        valley. A car was parked at the side of the road a little way beyond the pasture
        corner.<br/><br/>
        The car was obviously in distress. Otherwise, no man so well-dressed would have been
        tinkering with it out in the rain. I watched him as I went about my chores. Clearly, the man
        was no mechanic. He desperately plodded from the raised hood back to the car seat to try the
        starter, then back to the hood again.<br/><br/>
        When I finished my chores and closed the barn, it was almost dark. The car was still there. So I took a flashlight
        and walked down the road. The man was sort of startled and disturbed when I came up to him, but he seemed anxious
        enough for my help. It was a small car, the same make as my own but somewhat newer. It took only a few minutes for
        me to spot the trouble.<br/><br/>
        “It’s your coil,” I told him.<br/><br/>
        “But it couldn’t be that!” he blurted. “I just installed a new one, only about a month ago.” He was a young fel low. I
        would have guessed twenty-one, at most. He sounded almost in tears.<br/><br/>
        “You see, mister,” he almost sobbed, “I’m a long ways from home. It’s raining. And I’ve just got to get it started. I
        just got to!”<br/><br/>
        “Well, it’s like this,” I said. “Coils are pretty touchy. Sometimes they ’ll last for years. Then again sometimes they ’ll
        go out in a matter of hours. Suppose I get a horse and pull the car up into the barn. Then we’ll see what we can do for it.<br/><br/>
        We’ll try the coil from my car. If that works, I know a fellow down at the corner who’ll sell you one.”<br/><br/>
        I was right. With the coil from my car in place, the motor started right off, and it purred like a new one. “Nothing
        to it,” I grinned. “We’ll just go see Bill David down the road. He’ll sell you a new coil, and you can be on your way. Just
        wait a minute while I tell my wife where I’m going.”<br/><br/>
        I thought he acted odd when we got down to David’s store. He parked in the dark behind the store and would not
        get out. “I’m wet and cold,” he excused himself. “Here’s ten dollars. Would you mind very much going in and getting it
        for me?”<br/><br/>
        We had just finished changing the coil when my little daughter, Linda, came out to the barn. “Mother says supper’s
        ready,” she announced. Then, turning to the strange young man, she said, “She says you’re to come in and eat, too.”
        “Oh, but I couldn’t,” he protested. “I couldn’t let you folks feed me. I’ve got to get going anyway. No, no, I just
        can’t stay.”<br/><br/>
        “Don’t be ridiculous,” I said. “After all, how long will it take you to eat? Besides, no one comes to our house at
        mealtime and leaves without eating. You wouldn’t want my wife to lie down in the mud in front of your car, would
        you?”<br/><br/>
        Still protesting, he allowed himself to be led off to the house. But it seemed to me as if there was something more in
        his protests than just mere politeness.<br/><br/>
        He sat quietly enough while I said the blessing. But during the meal he seemed very fidgety. He barely picked at
        his food, which was almost an insult to my wife, who is one of the best cooks in the state and proud of it.<br/><br/>
        Once the meal was over, he got quickly to his feet, announcing that he must be on his way. But he had reck oned
        without my wife.<br/><br/>
        “Now, look here,” she said, and she glanced at me for support. “It’s still pouring out there. Your clothes are all
        wet, and you can’t help being cold. I’ll bet you’re tired too; you must have driven far today. Stay with us tonight.<br/><br/>
        Tomorrow you can start out warm and dry and all rested.”<br/><br/>
        I nodded slightly at her. It isn’t always advisable to take in strangers that way. Unfortunately, many people cannot
        be trusted. But I liked this young man. I felt sure he would be all right.<br/><br/>
        He reluctantly agreed to stay the night. My wife sent him to bed and hung his clothes to dry by the fire. Next morn
        ing she pressed them and gave him a nice breakfast. This meal he ate with relish. It seemed he was more settled that
        morning, not so restless as he had been. He thanked us profusely before he left.<br/><br/>
        But when he started away, an odd thing happened. He had been headed down the valley toward the city the night
        before. But when he left, he headed back north, toward Roseville, the county seat. We wondered a great deal about
        that, but decided he had just been confused and made a wrong turn.<br/><br/>
        Time went by, and we never heard from the young man. We had not expected to, really. The days flowed into
        months, and the months into years. The Depression ended and drifted into war. In time, the war ended, too. Linda
        grew up and established a home of her own. Things on the farm were quite different from those early days of struggle.
        My wife and I lived comfortably and quietly, sur rounded by lovely Greenbriar Valley.<br/><br/>
        Just the other day, I got a letter from Chicago. A personal letter, it was, on nice expensive stationery. Now who in
        the world, I wondered, can be writing me from Chicago? I opened it and read:<br/><br/>
        Dear Mr. McDonald:<br/><br/>
        I don’t suppose you remember the young man you helped, years ago, when his car broke down. It has been a
        long time, and I imagine you’ve helped many others. But I doubt if you have helped anyone else quite the way you
        helped me.<br/><br/>
        You see, I was running away that night. I had in my car a very large sum of money, which I had stolen from my
        employer. I want you to know, sir, that I had good Christian parents. But I had forgotten their teaching and had
        gotten in with the wrong crowd. I knew I had made a terrible mistake.<br/><br/>
        But you and your wife were so nice to me. That night in your home, I began to see what I was wrong. Before
        morning, I made a decision. Next day, I turned back. I went back to my employer and made a clean breast of it. I
        gave back all the money and threw myself on his mercy.<br/><br/>
        He could have prosecuted me and sent me to prison for many years. But he is a good man. He took me back in my
        old job, and I have never strayed again. I’m mar ried now, with a lovely wife and two fine children. I have worked
        my way to a very good position with my com pany. I am not wealthy, but I am comfortably well of.<br/><br/>
        I could reward you handsomely for what you did for me that night. But I don’t believe that is what you’d want.<br/><br/>
        So I have established a fund to help others who have made the same mistake I did. In this way, I hope I may pay for
        what I have done.<br/><br/>
        God bless you, sir, and your good wife, who helped me more than you knew.<br/><br/>
        I walked into the house and handed the letter to my wife. As she read it, I saw the tears begin to fill her eyes. With
        the most serene look on her face, she laid the letter aside.<br/><br/>
        “For I was a Stranger, and y e took Me in,” she quoted. “I was hungered, and y e fed Me; I was in prison, and ye visited Me.”`

        in no hurry to enter the rest of the house which seemed even emptier at night.<br/><br/>
        She would remember how everyone used to rush off after they had eaten - the
        boys up to their rooms and Peter to his favorite TV news programs.<br/><br/>
        Always so much to do and it seemed at times the boys would never grow up so she
        could have at least a little time to herself. Time for herself. Oh my, she had lots of time now,
        big blocks of time which filled so little space in her life. Especially now with Peter gone.<br/><br/>
        They had planned to travel a little after the boys all left, only Peter had been part of a different plan. She would
        give any thing to have those frenzied days back again, but of course it was impossible. There was her volunteer work
        and the house work and the occasional baking for bake sales, but she missed the noise and she would have been happy
        to hear the angry voices in the midst of a fight. “Ma, he took my shirt without asking” and “Ma, he won’t let me study.”<br/><br/>
        Ma, Ma, Ma. Sometimes she had wanted to throttle them, and now she wanted only to hug them and hold them close.<br/><br/>
        She looked at babies on the street and felt sad, remembering when her arms were also full.<br/><br/>
        She was being especially silly tonight, and she had told Charlotte, one of her neighbors who had dropped by ear
        lier, that today would have been her fortieth anniversary and they had talked of a special celebration this year. Foolish
        woman. After Charlotte left she had baked the chocolate cake that had been a favorite of Peter’s, and there it sat in the
        refrigerator, awaiting its trip to the table.<br/><br/>
        Last year the boys had all called, and they had laughed and talked about the big forty and how they would all cel
        ebrate, only there was nothing to celebrate now. In fact, no one had called, but you really couldn’t observe a wedding
        anniversary with half a couple. At least that’s what she had said to Charlotte, who kind of clicked her tongue at her and
        looked sad.<br/><br/>
        Feeling sorry for herself, was she? Come on, she scolded herself, let’s have a big slice of cake and maybe some
        treats for Max, who must have read her mind because he began to bark. Poor old Max. He had been Peter’s dog, waiting
        for him by the door each night till he came home. Some nights he still waited at the door which never opened, jumping
        up and barking at the slightest noise.<br/><br/>
        Like tonight. What was he barking at? He thought he owned the street, maybe even the world, but certainly
        any thing on this block was his terrain. Tonight something was setting him off. So she walked over to the window to see
        what it was. There was only a car. “For heaven’s sake, Max,” she admonished, “we’re not the only people on the street.”<br/><br/>
        Maybe Mrs. Boris, another neighbor, was having company. She had a big family and they came often to visit their
        parents.<br/><br/>
        But Max kept right on, and she thought she heard a noise at the door. Never fearful of the dark or the unknown,
        she went to the door, flung it open and said, “See, Max - there’s no one - oh my Lord!” They were standing there, the
        three of them, and they yelled, “Surprise, surprise” and suddenly there were hugs and kisses everywhere - her boys
        had come home.<br/><br/>
        “I didn’t think you’d remember and besides, with Dad...” Her voice trailed off in a blur of tears.<br/><br/>
        “Ma,” that was Josh’s voice, “you and Dad were always here for us, always in our hearts and our memories, and
        every anniversary will be our special day.” The others nodded, and now the tears were rolling down her face. “Hey,
        Ma, where’s the cake?” That was Chuck’s voice. “We want to party.” Suddenly she smiled and ran back to the kitchen,
        thanking the divine force that had directed her to bake her cake today and had given her three wonderful sons.`

        contentEn: `t age eighteen, I left my home in Brooklyn, New Y ork, and went off to study history
        at Leeds University in Y orkshire, England. It was an exciting but stressful time in
        my life, for while trying to adjust to the novelty of unfa miliar surroundings, I was
        still learning to cope with the pain of my father’s recent death - an event with
        which I had not yet come to terms.<br/><br/>
        While at the market one day, trying to decide which bunch of flowers would best
        brighten up my comfortable but colorless student digs, I spied an elderly gentleman having difficulty holding onto his
        walking stick and his bag of apples. I rushed over and relieved him of the apples, giving him time to regain his balance.<br/><br/>
        “Thanks, luv,” he said in that distinctive Y orkshire lilt I never tire of hearing. “I’m quite all right now, not to
        worry,” he said, smiling at me not only with his mouth but with a pair of dancing bright blue eyes.<br/><br/>
        “May I walk with you?” I inquired. “Just to make sure those apples don’t become sauce prematurely.”<br/><br/>
        He laughed and said, “Now, you are a long way from home, lass? From the States, are you?”<br/><br/>
        “Yes, I’m from New Y ork. I’ll tell you all about it as we walk.”<br/><br/>
        So began my friendship with Mr. Burns, a man whose smile and warmth would very soon come to mean a great
        deal to me.<br/><br/>
        As we walked, Mr. Burns (whom I always addressed as such and never by his first name) leaned heavily on his
        stick, a stout, gnarled affair that resembled my notion of a biblical staff. When we arrived at his house, I helped him set
        his parcels on the table and insisted on lending a hand with the preparations for his “tea” - that is, his meal. I
        interpreted his weak protest as gratitude for the assistance.<br/><br/>
        After making his tea, I asked if it would be all right if I came back and visited with him again. I thought I’d look in
        on him from time to time, to see if he needed any thing. With a wink and a smile he replied, “I’ve never been one to turn
        down an offer from a good-hearted lass.”<br/><br/>
        I came back the next day, at about the same time, so I could help out with his evening meal. For me, the great
        walking stick was a silent reminder of his infirmity, and, though he never asked for help, he didn’t protest when it was
        given. That very evening we had our first “heart to heart.” Mr. Burns asked about my studies, my plans, and, mostly,
        about my family. I told him that my father had recently died, but I didn’t offer much else about the relationship I’d had
        with him. In response, he gestured toward the two framed photographs on the end table next to his chair. They were
        pictures of two differ ent women, one notably older than the other. But the resemblance between the two was striking.<br/><br/>
        “That’s Mary,” he said, indicating the photograph of the older woman. “She’s been gone for six years. And that’s
        our Alice. She was a very fine nurse. Losing her was too much for my Mary.”<br/><br/>
        I responded with the tears I hadn’t been able to shed for my own pain. I cried for Mary. I cried for Alice. I cried
        for Mr. Burns. And I cried for my father to whom I never had the chance to say good-bye.<br/><br/>
        I visited with Mr. Burns twice a week, always on the same days and at the same time. Whenever I came, he was
        seated in his chair, his walking stick propped up against the wall. Mr. Burns owned a small black-and-white tele vision
        set, but he evidently preferred his books and phonograph records for entertainment. He seemed especially glad to see
        me. Although I told myself I was delighted to be useful, I was happier still to have met someone to whom I could
        reveal those thoughts and feelings that, until then, I’d hardly acknowledged to myself.<br/><br/>
        While fixing the tea, our chats would begin. I told Mr. Burns how terribly guilty I felt about not having been on
        speaking terms with my father the two weeks prior to his death. I’d never had the chance to ask my father’s forgive
        ness. And he had never had the chance to ask for mine.<br/><br/>
        Although Mr. Burns talked, he allowed me the lion’s share. Mostly I recall him listening. But how he listened! It
        wasn’t just that he was attentive to what I said. It was as if he were reading me, absorbing all the information I pro
        vided, and adding details from his own experience and imagination to create a truer understanding of my words.<br/><br/>
        After about a month, I decided to pay my friend a visit on an off day. I didn’t bother to telephone as that type of
        formality did not seem requisite in our relationship. Coming up to the house, I saw him working in his garden, bending
        with ease and getting up with equal facility. I was dumbfounded. Could this be the same man who used that massive
        walking stick?<br/><br/>
        He suddenly looked in my direction. Evidently sensing my puzzlement over his mobility, he waved me over,
        looking more than a bit sheepish. I said nothing, but accepted his invitation to come inside.<br/><br/>
        “Well, luv. Allow me to make you a ‘cuppa’ this time”.<br/><br/>
        “How?” I asked. “I thought....”<br/><br/>
        “I know what you thought, luv. When you first saw me at the market.., well, I’d twisted my ankle a bit earlier in the
        day. Tripped on a stone while doing a bit of gardening. Always been a clumsy fool.”<br/><br/>
        “But... when were you able to... walk normally again?” Somehow, his eyes managed to look merry and contrite at
        the same time. “Ah, well, I guess that’ll be the very next day after our first meeting.”<br/><br/>
        “But why?” I asked, truly perplexed. Surely he couldn’t have been feigning helplessness to get me to make him his
        tea every now and then.<br/><br/>
        “That second time you came around, luv, it was then I saw how unhappy you were. Feeling lonely and sad about
        your dad and all. I thought, well, the lass could use a bit of an old shoulder to lean on. But I knew you were telling
        yourself you were visiting me for my sake and not your own. Did you think you’d come back if you knew I was fit? And
        I knew you were in sore need of someone to talk to. Someone older, older than your dad, even. And someone who
        knew how to listen.”<br/><br/>
        “And the stick?”<br/><br/>
        “Ah. A fine stick, that I use it when I walk the moors. We must do that together soon.”<br/><br/>
        That Mr. Burns, the man I’d set out to help, helped me. He’d made a gift of his time, bestowing atten tion and
        kindness to a young girl who needed both.`

        contentEn: `I coached the World Champion Dallas Cowboys from 1960 until I retired in 1988. Except
        for a stint as a B-17 bomber pilot in World War II, my life has been focused on football.<br/><br/>
        I loved the rush of adrenaline before a game, the exhilaration of making a touch-down,
        the roar of the crowd, the thrill of each victory, the unique experience of playing in the
        Super Bowl -and winning a couple of times.<br/><br/>
        The deep satisfaction of coaching the players to learn to discipline themselves, to
        develop their skills and to work together as a team was a driving force in my life.<br/><br/>
        Encouraging the players to pay the price for their achieve ments and earning the support of the fans were very
        important to me. But there’s a part of my life that most of the mil lions of football fans do not know - my life centers
        around God and family - and helping at-risk children.<br/><br/>
        For many years now I have served on the board of Happy Hill Farm, a children’s home and special school located
        in the Texas hills. We simply call it the Farm; it is a five -hundred-acre working farm complete with horses, cattle and
        most important, more than one hundred hurting, troubled children whose families are unable or unwilling to help
        them.<br/><br/>
        I’ve seen some great victories on the football field, but far greater are the victories I’ve witnessed in hundreds of
        kids since Ed and Gloria Shipman opened their hearts and home about twenty five years ago. Some kids have survived
        unimaginable horrors and carry horrendous emotional scars with them. But more often than not, these battered kids
        leave the Farm with their life repaired, a high school diploma in hand, and ready to take on the world again.<br/><br/>
        Although each kid is special, I remember some more than others. I’ll never forget John, a frail little boy living
        with his mother in an abandoned car in a Fort Worth garbage dump before coming to the Farm. Or Frieda, a young girl
        who had been sexually abused by her step -father and brother. And Jack, whose father abandoned his family, leaving a
        single mom and a young son who always wanted to die. Jack had tried to take his life many times before coming to live
        on the Farm. And Amy, whose parents were in prison. Amy would have been killed had her desperate grandmother
        not found Happy Hill Farm.<br/><br/>
        And then there was Tip, a great kid from a small Texas town not far from Happy Hill Farm. Tip’s background was
        plagued with all kinds of problems. And when he slugged a teacher, a judge referred him to the Farm. Tip was only
        twelve, but he was large for his age. It was hard to tell that his hair was red because his father kept it shaved. “It’s easier
        to see the lice,” Tip quipped.<br/><br/>
        Tip had been labeled “white trash”. His family’s shack had no indoor plumbing, they got their drinking water from
        a well and bathed in a nearby creek. Personal hygiene and social skills were not high among the family’s priorities. Tip
        was uncoordinated, unmotivated and volatile. After being sent to the Farm, he had to be taught how to use a knife and
        fork. Having spent so much time outdoors, he had to be coaxed to sleep indoors on a bed. I recall how Tip would
        ramble through the house, knocking over vases and lamps as he gestured to make a point. But Tip didn’t really need to
        gesture because every other word coming out of his mouth was an expletive.<br/><br/>
        “I hate all these rules!” Tip screamed more than once. But there was one fate Tip would have hated worse - being
        confined in a juvenile jail. Because Tip had heard what it was like and concluded he wanted to stay out at all costs. So
        he began trying to follow the Farm’s rules.<br/><br/>
        Yet persuading Tip to sit in a classroom took days. Encouraging him to study required weeks. Re placing his
        profanity with more appropriate language took months and months. Perhaps the biggest challenge, though, was
        removing the chip from Tip’s shoulder. Large doses of unconditional love and consistent discipline were required to
        instill in Tip trust for authority figures and society.<br/><br/>
        And I watched Tip slowly change. Over the years as coach of the Cowboys, I saw a lot of impressive changes, as
        players became more disciplined, more skilled and more motivated. But the changes I saw in Tip and other bruised
        and suffering kids were far more dra -matic than any thing I had seen on the football field.<br/><br/>
        Tip finally graduated from the Farm’s high school. He was the first person in his large family ever to stay in school
        long enough to graduate. Tip was also the first male in his family not to serve time in a Texas prison. Tip’s
        accomplishments were among the greatest points I have ever seen scored. But more championship feats in Tip’s
        turbulent life were yet to come.<br/><br/>
        After graduating from high school, Tip went to work in the oil-fields of West Texas. He saved his money and had
        plumbing installed in his family’s house. He bought his mother a car. He helped his sisters go to school. He returned to
        his small hometown to work as a mechanic. Tip is now married and has four children.<br/><br/>
        The dehumanizing cy cle of poverty, brutality and imprisonment has been broken by Tip. His overcoming almost
        insurmountable obstacles is an incredible victory I feel privileged to have shared even a small part in. I love football -
        always have, always will - but mending the lives and hearts of boys and girls like John, Frieda, Jack, Amy and Tip gives
        me a sense of satis faction like no other thrill. Giving them a fair chance at liv ing their dreams is a victory far greater
        than a Super Bowl.

        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `n my work with women worldwide, I hear countless compelling stories of life and
        death - and love. Human emotions are the same the world over. The heartfelt
        yearning for understanding, forgiveness, acceptance and continuity of generations is
        universal as revealed in this human drama unfolding in Singapore - it could have
        been played out in the hearts of anyone anywhere in the world.<br/><br/>
        On this particular sundrenched morning, I made my way to my favorite coffee shop. Eating breakfast in a coffee
        shop on the way to work is quite the norm in Singapore. I sat at my customary table enjoying the steaming hot sweet
        coffee and pau. a popular Chinese bread. Screwing up my eyes against the glare, I looked out the door where I could
        see the corner of the sidewalk.<br/><br/>
        Something was missing - the usual vendor was not there. He was always there - his dilapidated bicy cle propped up
        against the lime-green Chinese shops, his pile of newspapers stacked neatly by his side. I’d miss his toothy grin, his
        cheery “Chou San” (good morning) if he did not arrive in time for me to buy my morning paper.<br/><br/>
        Most of us regulars at the coffee shop felt a real affection for him and called him “Uncle,” the Chinese term of
        respect. His seeming poverty did not hide his wisdom and graciousness. His wizened frame and beard made him look
        like a sage. Uncle Li seemed to lend an air of stability and constancy to my life. He may have been merely a newspaper
        vendor, but his cheeriness - like the song of an earlymorning bird - set the tone for the day. His “Chou San” brought a
        smile to all who bought a paper from him. Lighthearted banter constantly floated from his corner into the coffee shop.<br/><br/>
        Studying Uncle Li and his customers was my favorite morning pastime. A lovely young Chinese woman was the
        most interesting of all. Always immaculately dressed, she’d park her black car by the sidewalk, hop out, daintily run
        over to Uncle Li, buy a paper, and with a smile and greeting, away she’d go.<br/><br/>
        The emotions that crossed Uncle Li’s wrinkled face when she appeared intrigued me. His smiling face soft ened,
        and then gaiety gave way to a deeper emotion, one that I was familiar with yet could not define.<br/><br/>
        So, each morning, like Uncle Li, I waited for the arrival of the beautiful young woman. Black glossy hair, bobbed
        and fringed, encircled a creamy magnolia-colored, heartshaped face. Her dark eyes gave her a demure look. The most
        striking detail of her beauty lay in her smile, which lit up her face. Each day when she left, Uncle Li’s face looked like
        the sun shadowed by a cloud.<br/><br/>
        That morning, suddenly brakes shrieked, shattering my reverie and alarming the traffic on the busy street.<br/><br/>
        Commotion followed. I craned my neck for a better view. What had happened? Who was hit? A crowd quickly gathered,
        obscuring my view. The babble of voices told me nothing, and I could not determine what had happened.<br/><br/>
        Curiosity urging me, I edged my way into the spectator crowd on the sidewalk. The first thing I saw was a bicy cle
        tangled like a piece of modern sculpture. Loosened news papers caught by the wind scattered across the street.<br/><br/>
        Passers-by picked them up; others crushed them under-foot in their eagerness to get closer to the scene. “God, please
        don’t let it be Uncle Li,” I prayed. Like a coward, I retraced my steps into the coffee shop and sat down to view the
        frenzy through the door.<br/><br/>
        Police and ambulance sirens soon added to the hubbub. A young woman upheld like a rag doll between two
        police-men entered the shop. It was the young woman who drove the black car! I couldn’t believe it. The policemen
        gazed around the room imploringly. I gently took the girl’s arm and guided her to my table. The policemen explained
        that witnesses said it was not her fault, for the old man had lost control and swerved into her car. I further gathered
        that they could not locate his relatives, but she’d agreed to pay hospital expenses.<br/><br/>
        The young woman signed a form the policemen put in front of her. They then disappeared into the crowd, and I
        was left with the devastated woman. With trembling hands, she grasped the cup of coffee. Closing her eyes, she drank
        deeply from its comforting warmth.<br/><br/>
        Only moments before, I had felt on the fringe of events like any other spectator. But with the distraught young
        woman seated before me, I was drawn into the drama. Her face crumpling like a child’s, she broke the silence, “I can’t
        understand how the accident happened. The bicy cle struck the car; it seemed to come from nowhere. Why did Uncle Li
        lose control?” Shaking her head, she whispered through her tears, “How could this happen?”<br/><br/>
        Looking at me she implored, “Please, come with me to the hospital.” I agreed and rang the office on my mobile
        phone to explain I’d be late. She kept speaking, “I have to see him. I just have to see him and tell him how sorry I am.”<br/><br/>
        I could understand that for peace of mind she needed to see him comfortable, out of pain and alive.<br/><br/>
        She was not in a fit state to drive, so we took a taxi. It wove through the busy office traffic to the Singapore General
        Hospital. During most of the ride, we sat locked in our own thoughts. I pondered the morning’s events and realized I
        knew very little about the striking young woman, not even her name! So I introduced myself and asked her name.<br/><br/>
        “My name’s Sarah Wong.”<br/><br/>
        “Do you have family, and is there someone I should call?”<br/><br/>
        “No, I was an orphan and brought up by a wealthy old lady. I call her Aunt.”<br/><br/>
        I learned her life had been secure with nothing disruptive or hurtful except for the void in her heart because she’d
        never known her parents.<br/><br/>
        “My aunt is quite old, and I would not wish to distress her about the accident.” Sarah fingered the little diamond
        cross in front. No doubt a gift from her aunt, a symbol of her love and generosity.<br/><br/>
        We eventually got to the hospital. Sarah was as nervous as I was - concerned at what had happened to Uncle Li. We
        made inquiries and were told he was in the operating theatre. Our hushed wait began. My heart ached at the sight of
        Sarah’s pinched, pathetic face. She caught my sympathetic gaze, a tremulous smile touched her soft, young mouth; I
        really wanted so very much to allay her fears.<br/><br/>
        Before long, a blue-robed doctor, his mask drawn down capping his chin, approached the waiting room. We got up
        to greet him as he looked expectantly around the room. He must have been informed about Sarah. The doc tor
        explained, “Mr. Li’s rib-cage is badly injured, but we have managed to stem the internal bleeding.” The doctor
        continued, “The old man is frail, and his life hangs by a thread. If he lives, he’ll live with pain through his rest of life.”<br/><br/>
        Sarah softly asked, “Can we see him?” The doctor allowed us to visit Uncle Li in intensive care.<br/><br/>
        Puzzled with guilt and sorrow, Sarah was blaming her self and wondering how she could have avoided the acci dent. Her body shuddered. I put an arm across her shoulders as we came to intensive care.<br/><br/>
        We were directed to Uncle Li’s bed. Numerous tubes protruding from his body made him look like a collapsed
        puppet. His breathing labored and harsh, I expected at any moment to hear the death rattle-rumble from his throat.<br/><br/>
        I had wanted so much for Sarah’s sake for Uncle Li to live. But now for his sake, I wanted him to die. He’d never
        ride his bike again, never sell newspapers. We’d never hear again the cheery “Chou San.” I dug into my pocket for a
        crumpled tissue to wipe away my relentless tears while my young friend stood motionless, immobilized by sorrow.<br/><br/>
        Uncle Li struggled to open his eyes. They flickered and gradually opened. I saw a hint of a smile. I also saw
        something else - the emotion that had eluded me seemed to come alive as he peered at the young woman’s face. I felt
        like an outsider, intruding on an intimate moment. Feebly he lifted a hand. She reached out and held it, too choked to
        utter words she’d rehearsed in her mind. The old man’s face gathered strength, and the emotion I’d witnessed before
        was now reflected strongly in his face. He said to Sarah, “Ngo ke chai” (my child). Emotionally she responded, “Ahpah”
        (father).
        The puzzle piece fell into place, and I recognized the elusive emotion. The indefinable had become definable. It
        was beautiful, like the brightness of the evening star. In an unfor getable moment, love passed from a dying old man
        and filled the void in a young girl’s heart - like the love of a father for his child. Smiling peacefully, Uncle Li fell into a
        contented sleep from which he’d never awaken.<br/><br/>
        Sarah and I became friends, bonded together by that fateful morning. We visited Uncle Li’s sister, his only
        remaining relative. In her home, beside his picture, was the photograph of a young woman. I was startled. The
        resemblance was striking! I could have been looking at Sarah. Uncle Li’s sister explained that the woman in the
        photograph was Uncle Li’s wife. She’d died at childbirth, and their baby girl was stillborn. He’d loved his young wife
        dearly. He would have loved and treasured his daughter. Sarah had brought them both to life again, and in return
        Uncle Li had given Sarah a legacy of love`

        I woke up some minutes later with a neighbor I had never met leaning over me,

        you for deciding to take your nap out on the lawn where I could see you and come here. The sky is such a beautiful
        thing, and I cannot remember the last time I really looked at it.”`

        contentEn: `s a chauffeur for several years in the early 1910s, my father saw his affluent
        employer anonymously meet the needs of numerous people, aware they would
        never be able to repay him.
        One instance stands out in my memory of the many stories my father shared
        with me. One day, my father drove his employer to another city for a business meeting. On
        the outskirts of town, they stopped for a sandwich lunch.<br/><br/>
        While they ate, several boy srolling hoops passed by their “Tin Lizzie.” One of the boys limped. Looking more
        closely, my father’s boss observed that the boy had a club -foot. He stepped out of the car and caught up with the boy.
        “Does that foot give you a lot of trouble?” the man asked the youngster.<br/><br/>
        “It slows down my running some,” the boy replied. “And I have to cut up my shoe to make it comfortable. But I
        get along. Why ’re you asking me these questions?”<br/><br/>
        “Well, I may be able to help get that foot fixed. Would you like that?”<br/><br/>
        “Sure,” he said. The youngster was happy but a little confused by the question.<br/><br/>
        The businessman wrote down the boy’s name and returned to the car. Meanwhile, the boys picked up their hoops
        and continued down the street.<br/><br/>
        As my father’s employer got back in the car, he said, “Woody, the boy who limps... his name is Jimmy. He’s eight
        years old. Find out where he lives and get his par ents’ names and address.” He handed my father the boy’s name on a
        piece of paper. “Go visit his parents this after noon and do your best to get their permission to let Jimmy have his foot
        operated on. We can do the paper work later. I’ll take care of all the costs.”<br/><br/>
        They finished their sandwiches, and my father drove his employer on to the business appointment.<br/><br/>
        It didn’t take long to get Jimmy’s home address from a nearby drugstore. Most everyone there knew the boy with
        the clubfoot.<br/><br/>
        The small house Jimmy and his family called home needed paint and repair. Looking around, my father noticed
        tattered shirts and patched dresses hanging on the clothes-line attached to the side of the house. A dis carded tire
        hanging from an old piece of rope on an oak tree served as a swing.<br/><br/>
        A woman in her mid-thirties responded to the knock on the rusty door. She looked tired, and her furrowed
        features betrayed a life of hardship.<br/><br/>
        “Good afternoon,” my father greeted her. “Are you Jimmy’s mother?”<br/><br/>
        She frowned slightly before responding. “Y eah. Is he in trouble?” Her eyes scanned my father’s starched collar
        and pressed suit.<br/><br/>
        “No, ma’am. I represent a wealthy man who wants to get his foot fixed so he can play like all his friends.”<br/><br/>
        “What’s the catch, mister? Ain’t nothing free in this life.”<br/><br/>
        “This is no tease. If you’ll let me explain it to you - and your husband, if he’s around - I think I can make it clear. I
        know this is sudden. I don’t blame you for being suspicious.”<br/><br/>
        She looked at my father once again, and, still hesitant, invited him inside. “Henry,” she called out in the direction
        of the kitchen, “come in here and talk to this man. He says he wants to help get Jimmy’s foot fixed.”<br/><br/>
        For almost an hour, my father explained the plan and answered their questions. “If you’re willing to let Jimmy
        have these operations,” he concluded, “I’ll send you some permission papers to sign. Again, we pay all costs.”<br/><br/>
        Perplexed, Jimmy’s parents looked at each other. They still weren’t sure about all this.<br/><br/>
        “Here’s my card. I’ll write you a letter when I send the permission papers. The things we have discussed, I’ll put in
        the letter. If you have any more questions, call or write me at this address.” This seemed to give them a little more
        assurance. My father left. His mission was accomplished.<br/><br/>
        Later, my father’s employer got in touch with the mayor with a request to send someone to Jimmy’s home to reas
        sure the family that this was a legitimate offer. Of course, the name of the benefactor was not mentioned.<br/><br/>
        Soon, with permission papers signed and in hand, my father took Jimmy to an excellent hospital in another state
        for the first of five operations on his club-foot.<br/><br/>
        The operations were a success. Jimmy became a favorite of the nurses on the orthopedic ward at the hos pital.<br/><br/>
        Tears and hugs were shared all around when Jimmy left for the last time. They gave him a gift as a final gesture of their
        care... a new pair of shoes, specially made for his “new” feet.<br/><br/>
        Jimmy and my father got to be great friends as they traveled back and forth from the hospital. On the final trip
        home, they sang songs, talked about what Jimmy could do now with his fixed foot and shared silent times as they
        approached his house.<br/><br/>
        A smile flooded Jimmy’s face when they arrived at his house and he stepped out of the car. His parents and two
        brothers stood clustered on the weathered front porch.<br/><br/>
        “Stay there,” Jimmy yelled to them. They stared in amazement as Jimmy walked toward them. His limp had
        vanished.<br/><br/>
        Hugs, kisses and smiles surrounded the returned youngster with the “fixed foot.” His parents shook their heads
        and grinned as they watched. They still could not believe that a man they had never seen would pay a large sum of
        money to have a foot corrected for a boy he did not know.<br/><br/>
        The wealthy benefactor removed his glasses and wiped tears from his eyes when the homecoming was described
        to him. “Do one more thing,” he said. “Near Christmas time, contact a good shoe store. Have them invite every
        member of Jimmy’s family to their store to be fitted for a new pair of shoes of their choice. I’ll pay for them all. Let
        them know I will do this only once. I don’t want them to become depen dent on me.”<br/><br/>
        Jimmy became a successful businessman. To my knowledge, Jimmy never knew who paid for his foot surgery. His
        benefactor, Mr. Henry Ford, always said it’s more fun to do something for people when they don’t know who did it.`

        contentEn: `I’ll never forget Easter 1946. I was fourteen, my little sister, Ocy, was twelve and my
        older sister, Darlene, was sixteen. We lived at home with our mother, and the four of us
        knew what it was to do without. My dad had died five years before, leaving Mom with no
        money and seven school-aged kids to raise.<br/><br/>
        By 1946, my older sisters were married and my brothers had left home. A month before
        Easter, the pastor of our church announced that a special holiday offering would be taken to
        help a poor family. He asked everyone to save and give sacrificially.<br/><br/>
        When we got home, we talked about what we could do. We decided to buy fifty pounds of potatoes and live on
        them for a month. This would allow us to save twenty dollars of our grocery money for the offering. Then we thought
        that if we kept our electric lights turned out as much as possible and didn’t listen to the radio, we’d save money on that
        month’s electric bill. Darlene got many houseand yard-cleaning jobs, and both of us baby sat for everyone we could.<br/><br/>
        For fifteen cents we could buy enough cotton to make three potholders to sell for a dollar. We made twenty dollars on
        potholders. That month was one of the best of our lives.<br/><br/>
        Everyday we counted the money to see how much we had saved. At night we’d sit in the dark and talk about how
        the poor family was going to enjoy having the money the church would give them. We had about eighty people in
        church, so we figured that whatever amount of money we had to give, the offering would surely be twenty times that
        much. Every Sunday, the pastor had reminded everyone to save for the sacrificial offering.<br/><br/>
        The night before Easter, we were so excited that we could hardly sleep. We didn’t care that we wouldn’t have new
        clothes for Easter; we had seventy dollars for the sacrifi -cial offering. We eagerly waited to get to church! On Sunday
        morning, rain was pouring. We didn’t own an umbrella, and the church was over a mile from our home, but it didn’t
        seem to matter how wet we got. Darlene had cardboard in her shoes to fill the holes. The cardboard came apart, and
        her feet got wet.<br/><br/>
        But we sat in church proudly. I heard some teenagers talking about our old dresses. I looked at them in their new
        clothes, and I felt rich.<br/><br/>
        When the sacrificial offering was taken, we were sitting in the second row from the front. Mom put in the ten-dollar
        bill, and each of us kids put in a twenty-dollar bill.<br/><br/>
        We sang all the way home from church. At lunch, Mom had a surprise for us. She had bought a dozen eggs, and we
        had boiled eggs with our fried potatoes! Late that afternoon, the minister drove up in his car. Mom went to the door,
        talked with him for a moment, and then came back with an envelope in her hand. We asked what it was, but she didn’t
        say a word. She opened the enve lope and out fell a bunch of money. There were three crisp twenty-dollar bills, one
        ten-dollar bill and seventeen one-dollar bills.<br/><br/>
        Mom put the money back in the envelope. We didn’t talk, just sat and stared at the floor. We had gone from feeling
        like millionaires to feeling poor. We kids had such a happy life that we felt sorry for anyone who didn’t have our Mom
        and our late Dad for parents and a house full of brothers and sisters and other kids visiting constantly. We thought it
        was fun to share silverware and see whether we got the spoon or the fork. We had two knives that we passed around to
        whoever needed them. I knew we didn’t have a lot of things that other people had, but I’d never thought we were poor.<br/><br/>
        That Easter day I found out we were. The minister had brought us the money for the poor family, so we must be
        poor, I thought. I didn’t like being poor. I looked at my dress and worn-out shoes and felt so ashamed - I didn’t even
        want to go back to church. Everyone there probably already knew we were poor!<br/><br/>
        I thought about school. I was in the ninth grade and at the top of my class of over one hundred students. I won
        dered if the kids at school knew that we were poor. I decided that I could quit school since I had finished the eighth
        grade. That was all the law required at that time.<br/><br/>
        We sat in silence for a long time. Then it got dark, and we went to bed. All that week, we girls went to school and
        came home, and no one talked much. Finally, on Saturday, Mom asked us what we wanted to do with the money. What
        did poor people do with money? We didn’t know. We’d never known we were poor. We didn’t want to go to church on
        Sunday, but Mom said we had to.<br/><br/>
        Although it was a sunny day, we didn’t talk on the way. Mom started to sing, but no one joined in, and she sang
        only one verse.<br/><br/>
        At church we had a missionary speaker. He talked about how churches in Africa made buildings out of sun-dried
        bricks, but they needed money to buy roofs. He said one hundred dollars would put a roof on a church. The minister
        added, “Can’t we all sacrifice to help these poor people?” We looked at each other and smiled for the first time in a
        week.<br/><br/>
        Mom reached into her purse and pulled out the enve lope. She passed it to Darlene. Darlene gave it to me, and I
        handed it to Ocy. Ocy put it in the offering.<br/><br/>
        When the offering was counted, the minister announced that it was a little over one hundred dollars. The
        missionary was excited. He hadn’t expected such a large offering from our small church. He said, “You must have
        some rich people in this church.” We felt so surprised! We had given eighty-seven dollars of that “little over one
        hundred dollars.”<br/><br/>
        We were the rich family in the church! Hadn’t the mis sionary said so? From that day on, I’ve never been poor
        again.

        eighty-two, Bennett had every reason to consider himself a graduate of the
        classroom of life. But on this particular Sunday morning, Bennett’s face shone with
        the schoolboy brightness of a new insight.<br/><br/>
        And well it should! For I was the preacher that morn ing, and I had worked all week to string together the most
        dazzling pearls of wisdom ever displayed before this usu ally passive group of pewsitters. That morning I preached the
        splendor of heaven to folks I thought were hopelessly bound to earth. Surely this inspirational mes sage was the source
        of the brightness in Bennett’s eyes.<br/><br/>
        After the service, I greeted him at the door. “So, Mr. Kindrick,” I asked, “what did you learn today that has you so
        excited?” The question zinged from my lips like fishing line from an angler desperate for the compliment of a bite.
        “Is it that obvious? I’ve been this excited since last Friday morning.” He continued, “You see, I’ve been studying
        a particular passage of scripture for fifty years, and just this week, it finally made sense to me.”<br/><br/>
        Realizing that Bennett’s brightness had nothing to do with my message, I soon understood that it was he who was
        offering me a jewel - the truth that learning is a lifelong process. The revelation that dawned in Bennett’s heart at age
        eighty-two could not have happened if he had given up learning at age thirty-two. What if he had stopped trying to
        understand that verse at age forty two, or fifty-two or even seventy-two? The truth in that scrip ture verse might have
        escaped him. Only on that great Friday, after eight decades of experience and preparation, could he have been
        prepared to grasp that pearl of wisdom.<br/><br/>
        Bennett’s revelation encourages me never to tire in my quest for insight. I realize now that to give up trying to
        understand new things today is to forfeit lessons that can only be learned tomorrow.<br/><br/>
        When I got home after talking to Mr. Kindrick that morning, I rushed to look up the scripture verse he had been
        studying all those years. The verse made no sense to me.<br/><br/>

        contentEn: `Warm, friendly, attractive, gifted. That described Julie, one of my all-time
        favorite students from human development courses I taught at the
        University of Nebraska. She was a delightful person and an ideal
        student.
        I remember Julie coming to the front of the classroom after class one autumn
        day in September 197 6. While most of the other students hurriedly left to enjoy the
        balmy weather or to relax at the student union, Julie remained to ask questions
        about the next week’s exam. She had obviously already done some serious studying. Several other students overheard
        Julie’s questions and joined our conversation. Julie’s winsome personality drew people to her.<br/><br/>
        But Julie never made it to the exam. The day after our conversation, she was struck by a large truck as she biked
        through an intersection near campus. I was stunned to hear that Julie lay unconscious and motionless in a hospital
        opposite the campus where only hours before she was talking with friends, laughing, making plans for the future.<br/><br/>
        Only minutes before the accident, Julie and her mother had enjoyed one of their customary daily telephone
        conversations. Her mother recalls their last conversation. “Julie was so bubbly. At a store near the campus, she had
        seen an outfit she wanted to wear on a special date, and I told her to go ahead and buy it. She didn’t take her car
        because she would lose her parking place on campus. Instead, she jumped on her bike to go buy the new outfit. The
        accident happened just a short distance from the sorority house where she lived.” My thoughts cried out to Julie - You
        cannot die, Julie! You’re every professor’s dream - and every parent’s. You have so much to offer. So much to live for.<br/><br/>
        Nurses silently came and went from Julie’s room. Her parents stood nearby in quiet desperation. Then the
        phy sician entered the room, cleared his throat, and said to Julie’s parents and two brothers, “Your Julie has only a few
        hours to live.” He felt the freedom to ask, “Would you consider donating some of Julie’s organs?”<br/><br/>
        At that same hour in a neighboring state, Mary leaned forward, struggling to see better in her small, cluttered
        living room. Her eyes followed every movement of her lively two-year-old. This devoted mother was storing up
        memories to savor when she could no longer see her child. Mary was going blind.<br/><br/>
        Several states away, John had almost finished six hours on the dialy sis machine. This young father was reading to
        his two sons while his immobilized body was connected to a “artificial kidney.” Doctors had given him a grim prognosis
        of only weeks to live. His only hope was a kidney transplant.<br/><br/>
        At the same time in the Lincoln, Nebraska, hospital, Julie’s grief-stricken parents pondered the finality of the
        phy sician’s question. Their pretty brunette, brown-eyed daughter had once said she wanted to be an organ donor in
        the event of her death. The two parents looked at each other briefly, the anguish in their hearts reflected in their eyes.<br/><br/>
        Then they turned to the phy sician and responded, “Yes. Julie always gave to others while she was alive. She would
        want to give in death.”<br/><br/>
        Within twenty-four hours, Mary was notified that she would receive Julie’s eyes, and John was told to start
        preparing for a kidney transplant. Julie’s other organs would give life to other waiting recipients.<br/><br/>
        “Julie died right after her twentieth birthday - twenty-four years ago. She left us with very happy memories,” says
        Julie’s mother, now in her seventies. “Nothing -absolutely nothing - could possibly be as heartbreaking as the death of
        your child,” she emphasizes, “for your heart breaks again and again. At each birthday. At each holiday. At each
        milestone: when she would’ve graduated; when she might’ve married; when she might’ve been having children.”<br/><br/>
        Taking a slow and deliberate breath, Julie’s mother says, “But Julie’s life was a gift to us. Knowing that in her death, she
        gave the gift of life and sight to others is comforting to us, and remembering that we carried out her wishes has helped
        us cope with her death more than any thing else.”<br/><br/>
        Her voice softening, Julie’s mother says, “You and Julie’s other friends and teachers were an important part of her
        life. Your teaching influenced her life tremendously, and you remind us that our love for Julie and Julie’s love for
        others are alive today.”<br/><br/>
        As one of Julie’s professors, I hold the thought that I may have had a small part in teaching Julie how to live. But
        she - and her family - are still teaching me an even greater lesson: How to die.

        contentEn: `Electricity was discovered by the ancient Greeks, though it didn’t find its way to
        my in-laws’ farm until the summer of 1948. That’s when the truck from the
        Orange County Rural Electric Cooperative made its way down Grimes Lake
        Road, planting poles and stringing wire. My mother-in-law, Ruby, sat on her
        front porch snapping beans while the linemen set the poles. That night she
        asked her husband, Howard, what he thought of her get ting an electric sewing
        machine. Her treadle sewing machine was broken, the victim of two highspirited boys
        who had pumped the treadle to an early death.<br/><br/>
        They drove to Bedford the next day to the Singer Sewing Center and bought a brand-new electric Singer with a
        buttonholer, a cabinet and a chair. It cost \$240, money they ’d earned from selling a truckload of hogs to the
        meatpacking plant in New Solsberry.<br/><br/>
        Ruby set into sewing for her boys. After supper, when the table was cleared and dishes washed, Ruby would bend
        over the machine, churning out clothes for her chil dren and her neighbors. Thousands of dresses and shirts and pants.
        Clothes for dolls. Clothes for the minister’s wife in town. Prom dresses. Wedding dresses. The Singer raised its needle
        millions of times. Her family would fall asleep under Ruby -made quilts, lulled to sleep by the Singer hum.<br/><br/>
        The kids grew up and moved away. Grandchildren came, eight in all. The Singer stitched maternity clothes, baby
        dresses, baptismal gowns and quilts for the cribs. In 1987, Ruby called us on the phone, discouraged. After thirty-nine
        years, her Singer was limping. She took it to Mr. Gardner in the next town. He fixed sewing machines but couldn’t
        revive hers. He sent it away to Chicago. A month later, it came back, a paper tag hanging from its cord: Obsolete. Parts
        not available, the tag read.<br/><br/>
        I went to a sewing machine store the next day to buy a new one. Her old one was metal. The new machines are
        plastic and have computers and cost the same as Ruby’s first car. They give classes on how to use them. In the dis play
        window was a 1948 metal Singer blackhead.<br/><br/>
        “Does that one work?” I asked the man.<br/><br/>
        “I don’t know,” he said. “Let’s plug it in.” He plugged it in. It hummed to life.
        “It’s not for sale,” he told me. “It’s a display. There aren’t a lot of these old Singer blackheads around anymore.”
        I told him about Ruby - how she lives by herself and sews to keep busy, how she charges only six dollars to make a
        dress because the people she sews for don’t have a lot of money, how a lot of times she doesn’t charge a dime, how
        sewing is her ministry.<br/><br/>
        He sold the machine to me for twenty-five dollars.<br/><br/>
        The next weekend we hauled it down to Ruby’s. She was sitting on the front porch, watching for our car to round
        the corner on the gravel lane. She came outside and stood by the car as we opened the trunk. As she peered down at
        the 1948 blackhead, a smile creased her face.<br/><br/>
        “It’s just like my old one,” she whispered.<br/><br/>
        We wrestled it inside and installed it in her old cabinet. Perfect fit. Plugged it in. When Ruby heard the hum, she
        clapped her hands happily.<br/><br/>
        It’s still going strong. Ruby still charges six dollars a dress - unless it’s a bride’s dress. Then she sews it by hand.
        That’ll cost you fifteen dollars, but only if you can afford it.<br/><br/>
        She recently traveled north to visit her granddaughter Rachael. Rachael showed Ruby her Barbie doll, then asked
        if Ruby could maybe please sew some clothes for Barbie. The first night Ruby was home, she bent over her 1948
        blackhead, stitching matching dresses for Rachael and her Barbie. Way past midnight she sewed. The next morning she
        drove to town and mailed a package northward. Three days later her phone rang. Rachael called to say “Thank you and
        “I love you” and “When can I see you again?”<br/><br/>
        On two other occasions, my wife and I found 1948 Singer blackheads in antique stores. We bought them and gave

        contentEn: `As a child growing up in the Ozark Mountains of Missouri in the 1930s, I didn’t
        know we were poor - in fact, at the age of four, I really didn’t know what poor
        was. But I did know I was getting tired of eating oatmeal and being cold.<br/><br/>
        One day we heard a sharp, loud knock at the door. I clung to my
        mother’s skirt as she opened the door to what appeared to be a giant in overalls. His
        face was weather-worn, and his hair was long and poorly cut. His eyes were sharp.<br/><br/>
        “You’re Leonard Presson’s woman?” It was more a demand for information than a
        question.<br/><br/>
        “Yes,” Mother’s voice was shallow and frightened. “But he’s off hunting”.<br/><br/>
        The giant turned and waved to two boys in a wagon pulled close to the door. “Well we know y ’all didn’t get home
        from out West soon enough to put in a crop, so we brought you food to tide you over.”<br/><br/>
        While he talked, the boys unloaded sacks of flour, grain, sugar, canned food of several varieties and smoked meat.<br/><br/>
        Mother picked me up and stood against the wall. “We can’t pay...” she began.<br/><br/>
        “You’ve been gone a long time, Mrs. Eva.” His stern face softened. “These are bad times - people coming home
        ‘cause they lost every thing in the crash.” He waved the boys back to the now-empty wagon. “Be sure you’re in church
        come Sunday.” He swung into the wagon and picked up the reins. “You’ll be helping feed others next winter.”<br/><br/>
        Something resembling a smile split his somber face. “We help people take care of our own.”<br/><br/>
        That night we feasted, and on Sunday we were in church. My parents were greeted warmly by people I was yet to
        know.<br/><br/>
        Winter passed, and in the spring the hills and valleys that made up my world came alive with the promise of new
        life. Crops were planted and carefully tended. All summer we canned and preserved fruits and vegetables. The fall
        harvest was more than abundant.<br/><br/>
        On a bleak December day that was my fifth birthday, my father and two brothers loaded our wagon, and we all
        climbed up and drove to what had been an abandoned house across the valley. I sat bundled in blankets next to
        Mother. “This is the most important birthday present you will ever get,” she whispered. “I pray one day you’ll
        remember it.”<br/><br/>
        From my vantage high on the wagon seat, I watched my own father and brothers reenact the same scenario that I
        had seen a year earlier. I wanted to jump down and run to the children I watched clinging to their own mother’s skirts
        as I had done. That night in my prayer, I had a feeling of warmth; for what reason I did not know. But in my heart I
        could see those children, and I knew they slept well - and so did I.<br/><br/>
        Time passed slowly for a little girl growing up in the hills of southern Missouri in the early 1930s. As I grew older,
        I helped prepare the food that was taken by wagon to families who had come home to escape the paraly zing hardship
        of the Depression. I even met the “giant” who had come to our door that cold winter day. He was the father of the girl
        who was to become “my very best friend.” Even after we grew up and left the mountains to make our lives in the city,
        we corresponded and often met at family reunions in the Ozarks.<br/><br/>
        My mother was right. On my fifth birthday I received the most important birthday present ever. I’ve never for
        gotten the kindness and generosity of the simple but pro found people who believed that they were indeed their
        brother’s keeper.<br/><br/>
        Mother’s prayer has also been answered - many times. For the past six decades, no matter where or how I cele -
        brate each December 4, my birthday theme has been that act of kindness I witnessed on my fifth birthday. It has truly
        been a birthday remembered.`

        author: `Margaret E. Mack`,
        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `Fox River gave life to the country town of Colby Point, for the road and the river ran
        alongside one another. Colby Point was really the name of a road that crept between
        the hills and valleys of McHenry, Illinois. Homes were scattered here and there -
        mostly summer homes and retirement homes. At the very end of the road three
        houses all faced one another. Three sisters - all single, all seniors - lived in one of the
        homes. Across the way their widowed first cousin lived in a yellow house. Next to her lived
        their brother, Bill, and his wife, Cleo.<br/><br/>
        Cleo had multiple sclerosis, so the pair had moved to Colby Point seeking a quiet, relaxed life. Little did they know
        when they relocated to this serene area that they would end up rearing their granddaughter, Margie. Before long, the
        once-quiet neighborhood became active with the sounds of a child.<br/><br/>
        Margie always looked forward to the arrival of Christmas, and this year was no different as winter began to settle
        like a warm blanket around Colby Point. Everyone was in a flurry, for at the church Margie and her family attended,
        the congregation was preparing to share their Christmas wishes with each other. Since Cleo couldn’t make it to church,
        and Bill didn’t like to leave her alone for too long, he was in the habit of dropping Margie off at church early on Sunday
        mornings; the aunts would bring her home.<br/><br/>
        As Margie sat in church that morning, she rehearsed in her mind over and over what she would say. She wasn’t
        afraid, for she knew what an important wish this was. The service seemed to drag on and on. Finally the pastor uttered
        the words Margie had been anticipating all morn ing, “This is a special time of year when everyone around the world
        celebrates peace toward our fellow man. This year, here at St. John’s, we want to hear your Christmas wishes. We
        cannot fill everyone’s wish, but we would like to try and fill a few. As I call your name, please come forward and tell us
        about your Christmas wish.”<br/><br/>
        One after another, the church members shared their wishes, large and small. Margie was the last and the youngest
        to speak. As she looked out at the congregation, she spoke confidently, “I would like for my grandma to have church.<br/><br/>
        She cannot walk, and she and my grandpa have to stay at home. They miss coming so much. So that is what I wish for.<br/><br/>
        And please don’t tell them, for it needs to be a surprise.”<br/><br/>
        Riding home with her aunts, Margie could tell they were speaking in low tones about her wish. She hoped that they
        would keep her secret. As the next Sunday came around, Margie was getting ready for church when Grandma asked,
        “Why are you so fidgety? You haven’t sat still all morning.”<br/><br/>
        “I just know that something wonderful is going to happen today!”<br/><br/>
        “Of course it will,” said her grandma with a chuckle. “It’s Christmas, you know.”<br/><br/>
        Grandpa was getting on his coat when he happened to look out the front window. He saw some cars coming down
        the dirt road one after another. Now at this time of year there wasn’t too much traffic, so this was really amazing.<br/><br/>
        Margie pushed her grandma to the window so that she could see all the cars. Pretty soon the cars were parked all up
        and down the road as far as a person could see.<br/><br/>
        Grandpa looked at Grandma, and they both looked at Margie. Grandpa asked, “Just what did you wish for,
        Margie?”<br/><br/>
        “I wished that you and Grandma could have church. And I just knew that it would come true. Look! There’s the
        pastor, and everyone from church is coming up the walk.”<br/><br/>
        The congregation arrived with coffee and cookies and cups and gifts. They sang Christmas carols and listened to
        the pastor speak on giving to others the gifts that God gives. Later that night, Margie slipped out the back door and
        walked outside to look up at the stars. “Thank you,” she whispered, “thank you for giving me my wish.”<br/><br/>
        That was just one of the many wishes granted for Margie. Her childhood overflowed with the love of her
        grandparents, four great aunts and many wise, caring neighbors. Margie was truly a blessed little girl.<br/><br/>
        I should know - I was that little girl.`

        contentEn: `etty Olsen was just settling down to enjoy the golden years with her husband. The
        last of their five children was about to leave home. So, the couple had plans to
        travel. But then after thirty three years of marriage, he sprung a little surprise on
        her. “I’m leaving,” he announced. He had found someone else, twelve years
        younger.<br/><br/>
        The pain rattled her entire soul and body. Life seemed over, at least the life she had
        known for the last three decades.<br/><br/>
        “Starting over at age fifty-five won’t be easy,” Betty said. But she decided it would do her no good to feel sorry for
        herself. So she got busy. She joined a speaking program, became a volunteer at the American Cancer Society and
        trained as a docent at a local art museum. She played bridge and tennis, worked at the local blood bank, and got
        certified as a nurse.<br/><br/>
        But no matter how busy Betty kept, her heart remained cold and lonely. Nothing really captured her spirit. Then
        one day, two friends asked her to go on a bike ride. Not just any bike ride, but a century ride - a sixty-four-mile journey
        up and down the hills of Gilroy, California.<br/><br/>
        The couple didn’t tell Betty, then sixty, the distance of the ride. “Or I would never have gone,” she laughs. Betty
        had poked around town on a bike before, but that was about it.<br/><br/>
        The threesome hit the road together with a pack of other riders. As Betty huffed and puffed up the hill, she couldn’t
        believe the breathtaking beauty of the country side - the sage thickets, the velvet green colors of the brush... Nothing
        compared to experiencing the wildflowers, the sweet, dank smell of woods, even people’s front yards. That’s when
        Betty became enrap tured with biking. She had determined when her mar riage came crashing down that she was going
        to find new frontiers, new worlds to explore, new dreams to dream. She exclaimed, “Life really begins at sixty!”
        The enthusiastic novice joined two bike clubs and started to travel everywhere by bicy cle. First, she biked one
        hundred miles in the Inland Passage of Alaska where she saw bear footprints and golden eagles in flight, and watched
        cruise ships from a mountaintop. The next sum mer she traveled to New Zealand. But these rides weren’t enough for
        Betty. She wanted to try something more chal -lenging. Like biking twenty-five hundred miles or so.<br/><br/>
        Her first long-distance undertaking was a cross-country ride from San Diego to Jacksonville, Florida. That was an
        eighty-mile-a-day, five-week trip. Her children were terrified, and her sister told her, “Don’t do that. It’s too
        strenuous.”<br/><br/>
        Betty admits, “I, too, was uncertain I could make it!”<br/><br/>
        But nothing could stop Betty, and she had no regrets when she found herself amid towering pine trees and fields of
        bluebonnet lupines. “I had never seen any thing like it in my life!” she observed. In addition to the awesome sights,
        Betty loved stretching her limits and discovering new sources of inner strength. Invigorated, she convinced her forty-
        three-year-old son to tag along with her on some of her shorter rides, like the fifty-mile Tierra Bella.<br/><br/>
        Now seventy-three-years young, Betty has completed a total of three crosscountry trips, biked through forty-
        seven states, and visited thirteen national parks. She esti mates she’s done a total of seventy thousand miles on her
        bike since she started these great adventures.<br/><br/>
        Betty has made dozens of biking friends, and has been asked to remarry twice. “I turned both gentlemen down,”<br/><br/>
        she says, “because they weren’t into biking or hiking.” Betty thinks she needs someone a bit more on the active side.<br/><br/>
        Her riding spirit and intense journeys - which include a trip from San Francisco to Washington, D.C., and from
        Washington to Maine - have captured the interest of many journalists who have written her story a half-dozen times. “I
        find it’s an exhilarating fatigue,” she said. “I feel so healthy. I’m in better shape than I’ve ever been. It’s been a cure for
        loneliness. I have many friends. It’s not too strenuous. When you travel, you have no work, no shopping, no cooking,
        no meetings and no housework. And I’d like to get to know more of the his tory of our country.” Biking obviously is
        also helping Betty get to know herself better.<br/><br/>
        This paragon of health - phy sical and mental - has seen sights other people never see in their lifetimes. Once when
        touring in yellowstone, with all the bikers riding single file, a herd of buffalo joined them across the river trotting
        single file, too. In Costa Rica, she came eyeball to eyeball with a monkey swinging through the trees right toward her.<br/><br/>
        One summer, she saw swarms of stunning butterflies in the Ozarks.<br/><br/>
        These magnificent experiences are why Betty probably didn’t quit bike riding even after she got shot in the Napa
        Valley. She was at the very end of a bike line when a teenager shot her with a pellet gun. She was hospitalized for two
        nights, but doctors concluded that removing the pellet was too dangerous and decided to leave it where it was.<br/><br/>
        Within two weeks, this gallant lady -pellet intact - was back on her bike, cruising the Eastern Sierras. She had
        learned not to let a little detour stop her from exploring her newfound world. “Biking is so fulfilling,” she explains. “I
        just don’t have enough time to do all I’d like to do. I’d like to get to the garden, for example, but the weeds get there
        faster. I really love being with my children and my family, but I think biking adds a new chapter in my life.”<br/><br/>
        “When I rode the Oregon Trail, the Santa Fe Trail and the Natchez Trail, I felt like the pioneers.” She enthusias
        tically adds, “I hope my newfound discoveries will rub off on the rest of my family.”<br/><br/>
        Who knows? Maybe some of her family members are ready to embark on new journeys to broaden their horizons.<br/><br/>
        Two of her teenage grandsons are joining her in the Tierra Bella, and her young grand daughters were at her house the
        other day when they said excitedly, “Grandma, let’s go for a long bike ride.”<br/><br/>
        Betty hoisted her grandchildren, one onto a tricy cle and the other onto a twoseat banana bike. She hopped onto
        her bicy cle, and together they rode an entire five blocks before the kids were exhausted. They enjoyed the
        exhilaration of a short journeytha`

        contentEn: `My kids knew something was up the minute I took a phone call during dinner and failed to
        return for three hours. After twenty-five years of wondering and praying, that
        longawaited call finally came. To be frank, I can barely even remember what we said.<br/><br/>
        How do you fit twenty-five years of unanswered questions into one conversation?<br/><br/>
        Having learned that she lived less than twenty-five minutes from my home, we made
        immediate plans to reunite, the sooner the better. I emerged from the phone call with a very heady
        feeling and a date to meet her the next evening.<br/><br/>
        My husband knew about Nicole from our first date. I had a very well-developed sense of what I wanted in a lifemate. I knew I would spend the rest of my life with him and felt the need to share with him the story of Nicole. I told
        him with the hope that she would eventually rejoin my life. I wanted him to know that she would also be joining his.<br/><br/>
        I had gotten pregnant at the age of sixteen, after having been the victim of what is now called date rape. Nicole’s
        father was nineteen at the time, and I broke up with him immediately after he forced himself on me. My family
        fortuitously moved shortly thereafter. Having had sporadic menstrual cy cles, I wasn’t concerned with the missed
        periods. I must have attributed the baby’s kicking to gas. Being a healthy teenager, I carried her entirely inside, never
        showing until a month and a half before her birth.<br/><br/>
        It was Christmas Eve, after an argument with my mom, when she looked at me in a very serious manner and asked
        if I was pregnant. I was indignant and vehemently denied the possibility. It did give me plenty of food for thought, and
        a week later, I asked her to take me to the doctor. I’ll never forget her face as I casually asked the question. It was one
        of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do, mustering up enough courage to stop the denial and face the facts.<br/><br/>
        Upon learning that I was indeed pregnant and due within thirty to forty-five days, my parents rallied around me
        and assured me that they would support whatever decision I made. It wasn’t a hard decision to make, since I really
        had no bond yet with the baby. I chose to place the baby for adoption.<br/><br/>
        In those days, if the baby was to be placed for adoption, the mother was not allowed to see the child after delivery.
        Neither was any other family member, but the hospital staff didn’t know my mom. She managed to sneak into the
        nursery everyday of my stay and get as many looks at Nicole as she could steal. As we were leaving the hospital, my
        mom reminded my dad that this would be his last opportunity to take a look at Nicole. He had not joined my mom on
        any of her stealthy trips to the nursery. The social workers were scheduled to pick Nicole up from the nursery that
        day.<br/><br/>
        Dad unlocked the doors of the car, got us all settled, was about to drive off, then said, “Wait, I’ll be right back.” We
        waited, and on his return he simply said, “Kathy, she’s beautiful.”<br/><br/>
        I believe it was the hand of God ensuring I never had the opportunity to emotionally bond with the baby growing
        inside of me. When Nicole was two weeks old, we met at the Social Services office, where I was to spend time with her in
        a contrived living room setting. This meeting was to ensure that I still wanted to give her up for adoption. They
        brought her to me and left me there, alone with her, for fifteen minutes. That was a long fifteen minutes. I was a very
        young woman and terribly frightened I might drop her. I do remember thinking she was the most beautiful thing I’d
        ever seen, but I knew I couldn’t keep her.<br/><br/>
        We finalized the paperwork, the adoption process was initiated, and as far as we knew, she went to a family in
        Richmond, Virginia. I returned to school, finished out the year, and we moved at the end of the year. I went on to
        graduate from college and gained a commission as a naval officer. It was there that I met my husband. We married
        three months after meeting each other, nineteen years ago.<br/><br/>
        We went on to have two children of our own. Throughout the years, not a single day went by that I didn’t think
        about Nicole, and pray that she had a good, happy and healthy life. On her eighteenth birthday, I put a letter in her
        adoption file which detailed how to contact me in the event she ever came looking. My husband and parents were very
        supportive of this.<br/><br/>
        When Nicole decided to search for me, my letter made it very easy. The longawaited phone call had finally come,
        and my husband shared with me the excitement of the prospect of finally meeting my daughter. The day of the
        reunion, we sat our boys down and explained the situation. They were wonderfully supportive about it, and asked
        some frank questions, which we answered very honestly. Excited at the prospect of actually having a sister, they
        wished me well, gave me big kisses and sent me on my way to my reunion.<br/><br/>
        Nicole and I met outside the church after my choir rehearsal. I will never forget watching her climb out of her
        Mazda RX7 and just keep going up, up, up. She was tall, she was blond and she was gorgeous. We very slowly hugged
        each other with the gentleness afforded only the most precious, fragile treasures in your life. The rest of the evening
        was spent in a cozy restaurant down the street. The waitress was observant enough to realize that something very
        special was going on, and she prudently left us alone.<br/><br/>
        That night, Nicole told me that if she were to be limited to saying only one thing, she would thank me from the
        bottom of her heart. “Thank you for having me, for giving me up, and for welcoming me back into your life so warmly
        and openly.”<br/><br/>
        After twenty-five years, I felt as though a tremendous weight had been lifted, and I remember feeling as though
        there was simply nothing that could beat the joy I felt at finally knowing she was safe, healthy and had grown up with a
        very loving family. We went on to spend time together each week. She got to know her new brothers, and she very
        bravely accompanied me to many outings with our friends, getting to know all the people who are special in my life, as
        I met all those who were special in hers.<br/><br/>
        My husband took particular pleasure in our reunion since Nicole is almost a mirror image of what I looked like at
        her age. He loves to go out with us, feeling as though he has the best of both worlds, me at my current age, and me at
        the age we got married. Even now, more than two years after the reunion, he marvels at the fact that we have the same
        mouth, smile and laugh.<br/><br/>
        I don’t know if I can ever adequately express the gratitude I owe to her parents for having given her such a
        wonderful upbringing. They are really two very special people, and I am deeply indebted to them. They welcomed me
        and my family into their lives with the same open arms that welcomed Nicole. The card her mom gave me for Mother’s
        Day that year said it all: “I truly believe children are gifts from God, on loan, for us to raise to become independent and
        assets to society. Ever since we adopted Nicole, you have been in my thoughts - each February 17, but especially on
        every Mother’s Day. So, Happy Mother’s Day, not only have you found a daughter, but a best friend.” And to her, I also
        say thank you`

        sad that she tried to choose my friends. My mother went on and on about her mistakes and regrets as tears of pain
        streamed down her face.<br/><br/>
        Right at that moment my mom looked so beautiful. I wondered why my entire family, including me, took her for
        granted. How do you tell your mother all that she is to you? I wanted to tell her that the punishments and strict rules of
        my childhood have a small spot in my memory in comparison to my recollections of the nights she let me stay up late
        and bake cookies with her. I kept silent instead of telling her how much it meant that she scraped together the money
        for my wedding shoes and matching purse. I couldn’t swallow the lump in my throat so I could explain all of the
        millions of ways she makes me feel so special. I should have told my mother, on that day, that of all the people in my
        life, no one has ever loved me in the unconditional way that she does.<br/><br/>
        Four years have gone by since the day I didn’t tell my mother that her mistakes were tiny molehills, and her love
        and understanding were big beautiful mountains in my life. But I’m telling her now. Thank you, Mom, and thank you,
        God, for the world’s worst mother`

        contentEn: `As I contemplate the arrival of the holidays, I think about all the warm and wonderful
        Christmases as a child, and I feel a smile cross my face. They were truly a time to remember.<br/><br/>
        As I grew older, the Christmas memories become less vivid and more of a sad and depressing
        time for me... until last year. It was then that I believe I learned how to recapture that
        childhood wonder and joy I felt as a child.<br/><br/>
        Every year I flounder, never knowing what to buy my mother for Christmas. Another robe and
        slippers, perfume, sweaters? All nice gifts, but they just don’t say I love you like they should. I wanted something
        different, something she would love for the rest of her life. Something that would put that beautiful smile back on her
        face and the quickness in her step. She lives alone, and much as I may want to spend time with her, I can only manage
        an occasional visit with the schedule I keep. So I made the decision to become her Secret Santa. Little did I know that
        this would be just what the doctor ordered.<br/><br/>
        I went out and bought all sorts of small gifts and then headed to the more expensive areas of the mall. I picked up
        little nothings, things that I knew only my mother would love. I took them home and wrapped each one differently.<br/><br/>
        Then I went to my computer and made a card for each one. It went according to the song “The Twelve Days of
        Christmas.” Then I began my adventure. The first day was so exciting, I dropped it off and put it in the screen door.<br/><br/>
        Then I hurried home and called her, pretending to inquire about her health. She was bubbling over. Someone had left a
        gift for her and signed it “Secret Santa.”<br/><br/>
        The next day, the same scenario played out. After four or five days, I went to her house, and my heart just broke.<br/><br/>
        She had laid out all the gifts on her kitchen table and was showing them to everyone at the apartment complex.<br/><br/>
        Wrappings and all were spread out and each one had the note attached. She never stopped talking about this secret
        admirer the entire duration of my visit. Her eyes sparkled, and her voice was lilting. She was in seventh heaven. Every
        day, she would call me with news of the new gift she found when she woke up. Then she decided to try to catch the
        person responsible and slept on the couch with the door cracked open. So I left it later that day, and she worried that
        the gifts weren’t coming anymore. She had me just as excited as she was. On the last day, the card told her to be
        dressed on that Saturday, and she was to go to Applebee’s for dinner. There she would meet her Secret Santa. She went
        wild. The card also told her to ask her daughter Susan to bring her (that’s me). It said she would know her Secret Santa
        by the red ribbon she would be wearing. So I picked her up and off we went.<br/><br/>
        When we arrived the hostess seated us at a table, and my mom looked around. She lost the smile and ask when she
        was going to meet her Secret Santa. I slowly took off my coat, and there was the red ribbon. She began to cry and fuss
        over how much I spent and how did I do this. She was happier than I have ever seen her.<br/><br/>
        When it was all said and done, I thought about how good I felt, and just as quickly, I remembered something very
        important. When I was a child, it was my mother who taught me that it is better to give than to receive. All these years
        when I had been sad during the holidays was most likely because I was looking at the “getting” instead of the “giving.” I
        was humbled by this realization, and now I am certain, Mom does know best....

        contentEn: `It took me a while to realize what day it was. I awoke to gray skies and the chance of snow in the
        forecast for Wednesday, January twenty-eighth. My birthday. I was thirty five. I turned away
        from the clock radio and wished I’d taken the day off from work. I wanted to stay in bed and
        snuggle up to myself-pity about being alone - yet again - on this significant day. My most recent
        attempt at romance had crashed and burned two weeks earlier, and the wounds were still fresh.<br/><br/>
        It hadn’t been a long relationship, and it wasn’t even that much of a relationship, but it had refueled
        my hopes and dreams about having someone to come home to. As I lay in bed, I remembered
        blowing out last year’s candles and wishing for the man of my dreams - sure that my luck would
        change this year. “What the hell is it gonna take?” I asked my walls, angry and terrified at the same time. When the
        phone rang, I expected to hear warm wishes from my parents or brothers. Instead, it was a man that I once was in
        contact with, calling to say hi and completely forgetting my birthday. My sister-in-law called next, updating me on her
        happy life with my brother, and putting my two-year-old niece on the phone to sing to me. I hung up, fed my cat, and
        tried to remember what I loved about the single life when I was twenty.<br/><br/>
        Adding to the gloom was the fact that I no longer liked my job as a news reporter. I was dragging myself into the
        radio station everyday, trying to figure out where else I could go and what else I should be doing. Today would be
        bearable, I thought, because they ’d probably have a party for me at work, or maybe my recent ex would do the
        unexpected and send flowers. I was also looking forward to interviewing a favorite jazz musician whose saxophone and
        sense of humor were typically delightful. Little did I know that he’d be cranky and so uncooperative that I wanted to
        shout, “Screw you and your attitude - I shouldn’t even be here today!” To add insult to injury, my co-workers forgot
        my birthday, and I went home in a snit, empty -handed, slipping in the snow and cursing myself for wearing boots with
        high heels.<br/><br/>
        A dinner party with a great circle of women was the bright spot in my day, as my friends made me laugh and look
        on the bright side of my romantic disaster. But after they left, the sadness returned. I didn’t want to be alone at the end
        of the day, I didn’t want to be alone at age thirty-five, and I didn’t know where my life was going. My parents had left
        me a birthday message, and I was glad that I had missed the call, because I didn’t want to talk to them when I felt like
        such a miserable failure as a daughter and as a woman. I questioned my choices in life, and wondered just what I had
        passed up marriage and motherhood for. What was so great about my independent life?<br/><br/>
        I poured myself a glass of wine and sat down to seek comfort from birthday cards that I’d grabbed from the
        mailbox after work. One envelope reached out to me with the familiar, feminine script of my mother. I pulled out a
        pink card that read, “The only thing better than having a delightful daughter is watching her become a beautiful
        woman.” Inside, were these unexpected words:<br/><br/>
        “As I write, it’s snowing outside - just like the day you were born, thirty-five years ago. I’ll never forget the
        moment they placed you in my arms. I was so thrilled to have a baby girl - it was a dream come true! Through the
        years, you continue to be a delight to me - so sweet and thoughtful, and smart and talented. I am so grateful for our
        friendship, and I admire your courage and adventurous spirit. You are a warm and beautiful woman, Kim Childs, and
        you are my best friend. Know that I wish you a wonderful year ahead - filled with every thing you desire and deserve! I
        love you, XXOO Mom.”<br/><br/>
        My teardrops hit the card as I read those powerful words of love. I cried for the deep connection I had to this
        woman who considered me a gift, a success and an inspiration. Her message stirred my soul and breathed new life into
        me. I knew, as I lay down to sleep that night, that I was treasured, and that my life made a difference and brought joy
        to someone I cherished. It was my mother’s second -greatest birthday gift to me - thirty-five years after the first.

        I look at the breakfast dishes in the sink and then at her big brown eyes.<br/><br/>
        “Okay,” I say, and we snuggle together on the couch and watch her favorite show.<br/><br/>
        After the show, we put together a puzzle and I head for the kitchen to wash those dirty dishes
        when the phone rings. “Hi,” my friend says, “What have you been doing?”<br/><br/>
        “Well,” I say, “watching my little one’s favorite show with her and putting together a puzzle.”<br/><br/>
        “Oh,” she says, “so you’re not busy today.” No, I think to myself, just busy making memories.<br/><br/>
        After lunch, Erica says, “Mommy, please play a game with me.” Now I am looking at not only the breakfast dishes
        but also the lunch dishes piled in the sink. But again, I look at those big brown eyes and I remember how special it felt
        when my mom played games with me when I was a little girl.<br/><br/>
        “Sounds like fun,” I answer, “but just one game.” We play her favorite game, and I can tell she is delighting in
        every moment.<br/><br/>
        When the game ends, she says, “Please read me a story.”<br/><br/>
        “Okay,” I say, “but just one.”<br/><br/>
        After reading her favorite story, I head for the kitchen to tackle those dishes. With the dishes now done, I start to
        fix supper. My willing little helper comes eagerly to the kitchen to help me with my task. I’m running behind and
        thinking about how much faster I could do this if my sweet little one would just go play or watch a video, but her
        willingness to help and her eagerness to learn how to do what her mommy is doing melts my heart, and I say, “Okay,
        you can help,” knowing it will probably take twice as long.<br/><br/>
        As supper is about ready, my husband comes home from work and asks, “What did you do today?”<br/><br/>
        I answer, “Let’s see, we watched her favorite show and we played a game and read a book. I did the dishes and
        vacuumed; then with my little helper, I fixed supper.”<br/><br/>
        “Great,” he says, “I’m glad you didn’t have a busy day today.”<br/><br/>
        But I was busy, I think to myself, busy making memories.<br/><br/>
        After supper, Erica says, “Let’s bake cookies.”<br/><br/>
        “Okay,” I say, “let’s bake cookies.”<br/><br/>
        After baking cookies, once again I am staring at a mountain of dishes from supper and cookie baking, but with the
        smell of warm cookies consuming the house, I pour us a glass of cold milk and fill a plate with warm cookies and take
        them to the table. We gather around the table eating cookies, drinking milk, talking and making memories.<br/><br/>
        No sooner have I tackled those dishes than my little sweetie comes tugging at my shirt, saying, “Could we take a
        walk?”<br/><br/>
        “Okay,” I say, “let’s take a walk.”<br/><br/>
        The second time around the block I’m thinking about the mountain of laundry that I need to get started on and the
        dust encompassing our home; but I feel the warmth of her hand in mine and the sweetness of our conversation as she
        enjoys my undivided attention, and I decide at least once more around the block sounds like a good idea.<br/><br/>
        When we get home, my husband asks, “Where have you been?”<br/><br/>
        “We’ve been making memories,” I say.<br/><br/>
        A load in the wash and, my little girl all bathed and in her gown, the tiredness begins to creep in as she says, “Let’s
        fix each other’s hair.”<br/><br/>
        I’m so tired! my mind is saying, but I hear my mouth saying, “Okay, let’s brush each other’s hair.” With that task
        complete, she jumps up excitedly, “Let’s paint each other’s nails! Please!” So she paints my toenails, and I paint her
        fingernails, and we read a book while waiting for our nails to dry. I have to turn the pages, of course, because her
        fingernails are still drying.<br/><br/>
        Then we put away the book and say our prayers. My husband peeks his head in the door, “What are my girls
        doing?” he asks.<br/><br/>
        “Making memories,” I answer.<br/><br/>
        “Mommy,” she says, “will you lay with me until I fall asleep?”<br/><br/>
        “Yes,” I say, but inside I’m thinking, I hope she falls asleep quickly so I can get up; I have so much to do.<br/><br/>
        About that time, two precious little arms encircle my neck as she whispers, “Mommy, nobody loves you as much
        as I do.” I feel the tears roll down my cheeks as I thank God for the day we spent making memories.

        contentEn: `I wouldn’t be your daughter if you paid me!” I vehemently declared to my new stepmother,
        in response to her introducing me as her daughter to a man fixing our windows. That was
        one of the many conflicts we had throughout my high school years. In my rebellious
        youth, my insecurity compelled me to lash out, to hurt people before they hurt me.<br/><br/>
        Imagine a divorced woman, living in Colorado with two small children, ages three and five, who
        meets, falls in love with, and decides to marry a man who lives in New Mexico. To do so, she must
        sell her home, give up the teaching job that she loves, and go to court against her exhusband, in
        order to be allowed to move her children out of the state. After all this, she is confronted with two unruly teenagers,
        my brother and me, who are convinced she is the enemy and the source of all their problems. When she secures a job
        as a history teacher at their high school, they inform friends that she is a “witch.” They pick on her children with a
        relentless cruelty. They embarrass her, insult her and ignore her. How does she respond?<br/><br/>
        With pure, unconditional love. She laid down the rules. Dinner was at 6:30 P.M. I had to call by 6:00 if I wouldn’t
        be there. In addition to family dinners, there would be family nights and family vacations.<br/><br/>
        I was used to being independent, basically coming and going as I pleased. Mary Jo wanted to know what my
        schedule was and who my friends were. The minimal rule was to say “Hello” when I came home and “Good-by e” before
        going anywhere. I tried to avoid even this, sneaking in the house, up to my room with friends. She would appear
        instantly, “Hi, I’m Mary Jo, Alice’s stepmother. What’s your name?”<br/><br/>
        When she tried to talk to me, I yelled and walked away. When she tried to hug me, I pushed her away. She said, “I
        know you don’t like it, but I’m going to hug you anyway.” She wrote me letters and signed them, “I love you!” I tore
        them up and threw them in the garbage where she could see them. The next letters said, “I know you’re going to tear
        this up. I love you, anyway! Mary Jo.”<br/><br/>
        On my sixteenth birthday Mary Jo and I got into an argument because I was picking on her daughter. I was sent to
        my room. I called my friends to meet me on the corner and climbed out the window. I got home around 6:00 that
        evening, afraid to go in the house. As I pushed the door open and stepped in, I heard, “Surprise!” Six of my girlfriends
        were sitting around the table, which was full of food and presents. Mary Jo had planned the party and cooked for me.
        She treated me like a princess in front of my friends. I felt so special, yet so guilty. When the party was over, Mary Jo
        said, “Happy birthday. I love you.”<br/><br/>
        One day I was walking past my dad and Mary Jo’s bedroom. I heard her crying. I don’t remember what she was
        saying, but it was about me and how she never knew how tough it all would be. To say I stopped acting out or that we
        never fought again would be an exaggeration, but listening to her pain invited me one step closer to her.<br/><br/>
        Most of my anger and hurt was about my father, his past actions and the walls we had built between us over the
        years. Mary Jo was often caught in the middle. Over time, I came to love and respect her. Since the day my father had
        introduced her, I thought she was beautiful. I used to sincerely question, “What do you see in him?” She would tell me
        all the good things about my father I was desperately trying to forget in an effort to hate him. I asked that question and
        heard the answer so much that I began to see the good that she saw in him. After a while, there was a bridge where
        there used to be a wall.<br/><br/>
        When I was in trouble, Mary Jo dealt with my behaviour directly. She told me what I had done wrong and what the
        punishment was. She didn’t make a big production. She made it clear what she would and would not tolerate. In the
        midst of it all, she built myself-esteem by saying things like, “You’re better than that” and “I expect more from
        someone like you.” After hearing, “You’re always doing things like this” and “Are you going to be a permanent
        problem?” for years, I walked away from Mary Jo’s lectures feeling two inches taller.<br/><br/>
        More important than how she dealt with my unruly behavior was that she taught me positive alternatives and
        introduced me to things I could feel good about. To an outsider, playing cards, cooking and family dinners may be
        casual events, but these events were like shots of joy and self-worth to me. They were medicine for a sickness that I
        could have lasted a lifetime.<br/><br/>
        One of the strongest medicines I have ever tasted is running. That, too, was a gift from Mary Jo. I had never run
        before, but I figured if she could do it so could I. I have run, and won, many races since that day. Mary Jo and I have
        run through mountains and neighborhoods together. In high school, I ran track and crosscountry. I acted as if I didn’t
        care if Mary Jo came to my races or not, as well as ignoring her when she did. Sometimes I wouldn’t even tell her if I
        had one, but she’d find out through the school. Before I’d start, I’d scan the crowd. When I saw her face, though I told
        no one, comfort surged through my body.<br/><br/>
        To say Mary Jo made a positive difference in my life is an understatement. She made a pivotal difference in my
        life. She served as a role model, a mother and a friend. She taught me what it means to be a family and created events
        that make up some of my most cherished memories. She made every holiday a happy celebration. She passed down
        the gift of running, which has given me strength, peace, privacy, a place to cry, to pray, to evolve. She taught me the
        manners that have allowed me to excel in business and in life.<br/><br/>
        Above it all, Mary Jo taught me about love. She showed me that love cures; love softens; love sees beneath the
        tough exterior; love changes people; love is the creator of metamorphosis.<br/><br/>
        Today, I am proud for Mary Jo to call me her daughter, and I am privileged to call her my friend`

        myself. I can’t make up for the past, but I can try to do the right thing in the present.<br/><br/>
        When you were a child, I tried hard to help you become self-reliant and resourceful, and it may have seemed to
        you that I refused to help, to give rides, make arrangements, etc., when I could have. Now I think you have become a
        self-reliant, resourceful person, and I will help you whenever I can.<br/><br/>
        I will require that you be as honest as you can be, that you will ask for help when you need it, that you tell me what
        is going on with you as much as you can, that you take responsibilities that you are ready for and that you not take the
        ones that you are not ready for, and that we never lose sight of the fact that we are just two human beings trying to
        play this game as well as we can. I’ll be the mother, you be the daughter, and we’ll do our best.<br/><br/>
        As you travel through these next six years, you can count on me to be here, to love you, respect you, to guide you
        whenever you need it. I will be available to talk about any thing, any time, without condemning you. I will not act like
        your therapist or your teacher. I will try to talk more about things that should be talked about in case you don’t quite
        dare ask. If I do something stupid, or break any of these promises, you can tell me. Good luck!<br/><br/>
        I am looking forward to knowing the beautiful, intelligent, capable, loving woman that you are becoming`

        author: `Win Herberg`,
        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `My daughter’s tears started as we drove out of our familiar driveway and toward the
        highways that would take us over nine hundred miles to Colorado and her first year of
        college. These were the streets she and I had traveled hundreds of happy times, going
        here or there, many times sharing thoughts and laughter. How perceptive she is, I have
        often thought, at reading people and situations, getting to the core of any matter, and
        putting into words the clarity of her thoughts. She is so much more capable of this than I was at her
        age.<br/><br/>
        Now she could not find the words to say why she was crying on an occasion that should have been mostly happy. I
        thought she should be feeling the excitement of beginning a life for herself away from home - that she would be
        exhilarated at the prospect of being on her own and free from her parents’ constant scrutiny. What went wrong?
        Was she crying because she would be away for an extended period for the first time, because she would be leaving
        her friends, familiar places and faces, and her family or because she was leaving her best friend and first love, a young
        man she met months ago? This was the loss that seemed to have the greatest impact on her at this time.<br/><br/>
        I hoped the long trip would be another happy time for the two of us when we could talk freely and deeply for the
        two days we would be on the road. Her sorrow made it difficult to converse about the good times of the past and the
        new experiences she could look forward to. Though the tears eventually subsided, there would be no bonding on this
        day, and my chance to impress her with my best worldly advice had passed. Mostly we shared silence.<br/><br/>
        The next day when the mountains came into view and loomed larger so, too, did the reality of her future in this
        beautiful city. As the mountains grew, so did her spirits. We exchanged superficial talk.<br/><br/>
        Finally, we were on campus, and she was moving into her room, unpacking and settling in. She and her room-mate
        seemed to hit it off right away. Both liked thick coffee and country music; both were messy and had to set the alarm
        clock far away the bed to get out of bed in the morning. I never thought I’d see these habits as positive traits.<br/><br/>
        The orientation schedule was informative but gruelling. There were meetings for parents only, for students only,
        and for both parents and students together. I learned that this university is one of the top-ten party schools in the
        nation, that sexually transmitted diseases are epidemic and that two-thirds of the freshman class is on academic
        probation after the first midterms. Why did we agree to let her go to school here?<br/><br/>
        It was difficult for us to find our way around a six-hundred-acre campus where most of the buildings looked the
        same and where I needed my glasses to read the building names. Our differing methods of finding our way caused more
        friction between the two of us than any thing else. I was into map reading, and she was into following her nose on the
        random chance that it would take her to the right building.<br/><br/>
        On the final day of orientation, registration was thoroughly frustrating, even maddening. It seemed as though
        none of the classes she wanted to take were open, and there were long lines for every step of the registration process.<br/><br/>
        There was one advisor for approximately fifteen students. Only through her perseverance to wait for hours the next
        day to meet alone with an advisor did she get the classes she wanted.<br/><br/>
        With a gentle nudge she made it clear that it was time for me to leave her on her own. Now the excitement was
        hers, and a lump settled in my throat and tears came to my eyes. If I was going to impart any great new wisdom, it
        would have to be done in the few minutes of our short leave-taking. What could I say that hadn’t already been
        expressed?<br/><br/>
        I told her of a time when she was very young. She and I went shopping at a large department store, and I was
        trying on clothing. She walked out of the dressing room leaving me in a state of undress and unable to go after her. By
        the time I got my clothes back on, she was gone. After frantically searching for what seemed like an eternity, I found
        her sitting quietly in the mall security office. It was a nightmare that seemed to describe this moment aptly. When she
        leaves me today, I will want to run after her. I still want her to stay with me, safe and secure. Now I am emotionally
        undressed; I cannot chase after her. As I gave her a final hug, I could not hold back the tears.<br/><br/>
        “I love you,” I said softly.<br/><br/>
        Out of nowhere she said, “Will you water my tear-drops?” This is our name for the plants she has sitting in the
        windows of her bedroom. The delicate vines cascade to the floor nearly covering one wall; the small, circular leaves
        and the fragile, lavender flowers resemble teardrops. We both knew what she was asking. Would her room be there
        when she returned, the same as she left it? Would her family be there for her as we always had been in the past? Would
        we drive and laugh and confide on the same familiar streets that surround the only home she has ever known?<br/><br/>
        Yes, we’ll water your teardrops.<br/><br/>
        She turned toward her new life, and I turned toward home. As the mountains diminished in my rearview mirror,
        so, too, did her presence. I became lonelier and emptier until the plains flattened my emotions. I managed to hold
        myself together for nearly twenty-six hours until the familiar sights of home brought cascades of tears.<br/><br/>
        Without her our streets are silent; our house is empty; my stomach is hollow.<br/><br/>
        Who’ll water my teardrops?`

        author: `Barb Huf`,
        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `I heated up a cup of coffee today in the microwave. I wasn’t sure if I should laugh or cry as I
        stood there holding the steaming cup for the second time this morning. My son woke up
        crying, and it took nearly an hour of singing, consoling and rocking to get him back to sleep. In
        the meantime, my coffee got cold. So, I heated it up in the microwave.<br/><br/>
        I grew up vowing never to be like my mother. She is a wonderful, strong woman, and anyone
        would be proud to be like her. But I wasn’t going to be. No one in town seemed to know her name.<br/><br/>
        To the teachers and students at the various schools her children attended, she was simply known as....’s mom (fill in
        the blank with any one of her five children’s names). At the grocery stores and around the auto parts stores and
        hardware places, they affectionately called her “Mrs. Dale” after my father’s first name; and the folks at the bank, utility
        companies and other such important places addressed her with Dad’s last name, as Mrs. Keffer. Mom answered to all of
        these with a smile and kind words.<br/><br/>
        I, on the other hand, was never as gracious about it. Often, I would tell the bagger at the grocery store, “Her name
        is Joy ce, by the way,” as he handed her the bag and told her to have a nice day using one of the aforementioned names.<br/><br/>
        Mom would always smile and say, “You have a good day, too,” as she shot me the look of blaming. When we would then
        get to the car, I would bicker at her for not standing up for herself. “You are your own person,” I would retort. “You’re
        not an extension of Dad.”<br/><br/>
        “I could be called a lot worse,” she would always reply. “Besides, everyone knows your dad.”<br/><br/>
        Everyone in this small town did know my dad. He was a friendly, hard-working man who gave car advice to
        anyone who needed it. He could charm his way out of a speeding ticket and talk his way into a better deal with ease. He
        would not think twice about fixing a broken bike of the neighbor kid. Or leaving in the middle of a cold winter night to
        change a frightened teen’s flat tire.<br/><br/>
        But everyone knew my mom, too. While Dad was a great man in the community, Mom was equally special. She had
        her own way of talking herself into a good deal, and she loved to give friendly advice to people she met. If anyone was
        in need, my mom was right in the thick of the fight to help. She would collect items for a family who lost all in a house
        fire, canned goods for the church pantry, and clothes for a teen mother’s baby when no one else would help.<br/><br/>
        As a teen, I never understood my mom. How could someone with so much to offer the world be content to stay
        home and be known as an adjunct to her husband or as someone’s mother? Why wasn’t she proud of who she was? Once
        upon a time, she wanted to be a nurse and join the Peace Corps. How could she give up her dreams for washing out
        dirty diapers and packing my father’s sandwiches?<br/><br/>
        All I knew was that this was not going to happen to me. I had big dreams of making a difference in the world - but
        with a bang, not a whimper. People would know me. I planned on working my way up through the ranks of the YMCA
        with a busy writing career on the side. My husband, if there was one, would be right behind me and, as for children,
        they would be cute and at their nanny’s side. I would not be like my mother - I would be me. And people would know
        me as someone important.<br/><br/>
        Now here I was heating up my cup of coffee in the microwave for the second time. Just as I had watched her do a
        million times after setting it down to pack a lunch, feed the cats, tie a shoe, retrieve a towel from the dryer, find a paper
        that needed returning to school, answer the phone and a million other possible interruptions. I dreamed of downing a
        good cafe latte for breakfast before another busy day at the office, and here I was drinking instant mocha from a
        “Happy Birthday ” mug with colored balloons all over it.<br/><br/>
        I understand now. I understood eight months ago as I held my son for the first time. I understood when his tiny
        little hand wrapped around my finger and his big blue eyes looked into mine as he drifted off to sleep. I understood
        when the love I have for my husband tripled as I first saw the little body cuddled in his big, strong arms and saw the
        tears streak down his face. I understood it all instantly.<br/><br/>
        I look forward to the day that I will be known as Andrew’s mom to the people in town and the children at school.<br/><br/>
        Everyday, as my husband returns home from work and his face lights up as his son holds out his hands, I am proud to
        be Mrs. Frank Huff. Just like my mom is proud to be called Mrs. Dale Keffer. Just like my mom. Those are four words
        that I thought I would never say proudly.<br/><br/>
        By the way, if you see her, her name is Joy ce. And now I need to heat up my coffee again`

        title: `Faultfinding without suggestions for improvementis a waste of time`,
        author: `Mary Alice Dress Baumgardner`,
        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `I was six years old and my sister, Sally Kay, was three. For some reason, I thought we needed to
        earn some money. I decided we should “hire out” as maids. We visited the neighbors, offering
        to clean house for them for a quarter.<br/><br/>
        Reasonable as our offer was, there were no takers. But one neighbor telephoned mother
        to let her know what Mary Alice and Sally Kay were doing. Mother had just hung up the phone
        when we came bursting through the back door, into the kitchen of our apartment.<br/><br/>
        “Girls” mother asked, “Why were you two going around the neighborhood telling people you would clean their
        houses?”<br/><br/>
        Mother wasn’t angry with us. In fact, we learned afterwards, she was amused that we had come up with such an
        idea. But, for some reason, we both denied having done any such thing. Shocked and terribly hurt that her dear little
        girls could be such “bold-faced liars,” mother then told us that Mrs. Jones had just called to tell her we had been to her
        house and said we would clean it for a quarter.<br/><br/>
        Faced with the truth, we admitted what we had done. Mother said that we had “fibbed.” We had not told the truth.<br/><br/>
        She tried to explain why a fib hurt, but she didn’t feel that we really understood.<br/><br/>
        years later, she told us that the “lesson” she came up with for trying to teach us to be truthful would probably
        have been frowned upon by psy chologists. The idea came to her in a flash... and our tender-hearted mother told us it
        was the most difficult lesson she ever taught us. It was a lesson we never forgot.<br/><br/>
        After admonishing us, mother cheerfully began preparing for lunch. As we munched on sandwiches, she asked,
        “Would you two like to go to the movies this afternoon?”<br/><br/>
        “Wow! Would we ever!” We wondered what movie would be playing. Mother said “the matinee.” Oh, fantastic! We
        would be going to “the matinee”! Weren’t we lucky? We got bathed and all dressed up. It was like getting ready for a
        birthday party. We hurried outside the apartment, not wanting to miss the bus that would take us downtown. On the
        landing, mother stunned us by saying, “Girls, we are not going to the movies today.”<br/><br/>
        “What?” we objected. “What do you mean? Aren’t we going to the matinee? Mommy, you said we were going to go
        to the matinee!”<br/><br/>
        Mother stooped and gathered us in her arms. I couldn’t understand why there were tears in her eyes. But hugging
        us, she gently explained that this was what a fib felt like.<br/><br/>
        “It is important that what we say is true,” Mother said. “I fibbed to you just now, and it felt awful to me. I don’t
        ever want to fib again, and I’m sure you don’t want to fib again either. People must be able to believe each other. Do
        you understand?”<br/><br/>
        We assured her that we understood. We would never forget.<br/><br/>
        And since we had learned the lesson, why not go on to the matinee? There was still time.<br/><br/>
        “Not today,” mother told us. “We would go another time.”<br/><br/>
        That is how, over fifty years ago, my sister and I learned to be truthful. We have never forgotten how much a fib
        can hurt.`

        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `If I could be a mother all over again, I know one thing I would never change... how
        much I loved each of you. I wanted to be a mother from the time I was a little girl. I
        played with dolls long after the other girls had given them up. So being a mother and
        holding and rocking and nursing and caring for you was the joy of my life. But I look
        back on it now, and I think I probably treated you like my dolls. I picked you up if you
        cried. I held you when your ears ached. As long as you were in pain, I wanted to be there
        with you. But keeping you happy, safe, healthy, polite and studious seemed to be the responsibility of my mothering.<br/><br/>
        Happy could be lots of things: sleigh riding, picnics, swimming, parties for you and your friends, learning to bake or
        sew, or even learning to skate or ride a bike. Those were things that I was familiar with and knew how to help you learn.<br/><br/>
        But today looking back on how rich I might have made your lives if I had known then the things I have learned
        now - oh, how exciting it would be.<br/><br/>
        I would begin with sight. Not having your eyes tested for glasses: that I knew about and did - but learning to really
        see things. To see the way the sky changes color with just a little gust of wind. To see the leaves twist in the wind and
        shimmer with light. I’d like to teach your eyes to take in the shades of green and blue that rush across the waves or the
        sky, to see shapes and forms, not as objects but masses of color that change as you turn away from them; to see the
        world as an exciting masterpiece; to see a flower as a perfect vision. When the motto used to be “Stop and smell the
        roses,” I didn’t really understand. Yes, that is what I would do if I could start all over again with each of you. I’d stop
        and smell the roses with you and look at their colors and enjoy the fact that they exist.<br/><br/>
        Hearing, I’d teach you about really hearing. I know that I miss lots of words that I used to hear. I’m eighty-three
        and can’t hear much anymore. I know that my taste in music has not changed with the times, and I never wanted to
        hear your music! But also I now listen to the sound of the surf, or a train whistle in the night, or a loon over the lake in
        the early morning. Those are sounds that I appreciate today, and I wonder if I ever told you about the beauty of those
        sounds. Yes, I would have a new approach to teaching you about listening and hearing, not just to human words or to
        be quiet when adults are speaking, but to the sounds that are always around us. The city sounds of rumbling buses and
        taxi doors slamming, of street vendors hawking their wares or sirens telling us of an emergency, or the country sounds
        that are quieter and more peaceful. Yes, I think I would teach you about the beauty that enters through our ears.<br/><br/>
        And also I’d teach you to hear people’s feelings and hopes and dreams, the truth behind their words. I’d help you
        to hear pain and need, and I’d help you know how to respond. I’d help you to hear the whole world, in all its
        complexity.<br/><br/>
        “If onlys” aren’t much good though. I’m not a mother again, and my two daughters are both mothers and my four
        granddaughters are on their way to becoming mothers! No more babies to hold, children to teach. I miss that from
        time to time, but I notice that even though I don’t have those children to teach, I have never stopped teaching myself`

        minded the eternal “why ”. She made me consider the possibilities myself, jumping in
        only when my maturity or knowledge couldn’t encompass the entire issue.<br/><br/>
        When I wanted to do something, I had to review all possibilities within my limited
        scope. “What would you feel like if someone did that to you?” was a question always asked when I
        reacted to an issue or event. She guided me, made certain I attended church and Sundayschool
        and had a solid background of character and morality.<br/><br/>
        On my thirteenth birthday, all that changed. Entering my teens was heady in itself but attained an even higher
        ranking when Mom called me into her room after school.<br/><br/>
        “Anne,” she told me, patting the bed beside her, “I want to talk to you.”<br/><br/>
        “What’s up?” I asked easily, self-assured in my new-found teen status.<br/><br/>
        “I’ve spent the last twelve years giving you a sense of values and morals,” she began. “Do you know the difference
        between right and wrong?”<br/><br/>
        “Y eah, sure,” I replied, my grin slipping slightly at this unexpected opening.<br/><br/>
        “You’ve now entered your teens, and life, from this point, will be much more complicated,” Mom told me. “I’ve
        given you the basics. Now it’s time for you to begin making your own decisions. “
        “I don’t understand,” I told her. “Are you mad at me? What did I do?”<br/><br/>
        Mom put her arms around me, hugging me close. “Everyone has to begin making her own decisions in life sooner
        or later. I’ve seen too many young people let loose from their parents make horrible mistakes, usually when they ’re
        away at college and no one is there to give them guidance. I’ve seen them go wild, and some have ruined their lives
        forever. So I’m going to give you your freedom early.”<br/><br/>
        I stared at her, dumbfounded. All sorts of possibilities occurred to me. staying out as late as I wanted, parties, no
        one to tell me I had to do my homework? Super!<br/><br/>
        Mom smiled again as she stood and looked down at me. “Remember, this is a responsibility. The rest of the family
        will be watching. Your aunts, uncles and cousins will be waiting for any possible misstep. You’ll have only yourself to
        blame.”<br/><br/>
        “Why?” I asked, elated that she trusted me so much.<br/><br/>
        “Because I’d rather you make your mistakes now, while you’re at home and I can advise and assist you,” she
        replied, hugging me. “Remember, I’m always here for you. If you want advice, or just to talk, I’m available any time.”<br/><br/>
        With this she ended the conversation and the birthday proceeded pretty much as the previous ones had, with
        cake, ice cream, presents and family. I knew quite well she wasn’t stepping out of my life entirely, merely giving me
        space in which to stretch my wings and prepare for the flight I’d someday be taking.<br/><br/>
        During the coming years, I made my share of mistakes, the same ones all teenagers do. I neglected my homework
        periodically, stayed up late occasionally, and once attended a party I had reservations about. Mom never berated me
        for them. When grades slipped, she quietly pointed out that my chances for the university I wanted to attend would
        slip as far as my grades did, the lower they were, the poorer my chances of acceptance. If I stayed up late, she
        cheerfully chided me. After the party she simply asked me what I would those friends doing in ten years. Did I wish to
        share this future with them? Undoubtedly, I did not. When I saw this, I invariably altered my behavior to compensate.<br/><br/>
        I never resented her as so many teens do. In fact, this brought us much closer.<br/><br/>
        A few years ago, I took my daughter into my room on her thirteenth birthday. We had a similar talk. My son had a
        similar discussion with his dad at the same age. My children made many of the same mistakes that are the milestones of
        growth and maturity, but many others they passed by because they thought about it and came to us to discuss it first.<br/><br/>
        They looked at us as mentors rather than jailers, and we’ve all been better for it.<br/><br/>
        Honor, love and respect for the wisdom of experience are valued in our family because of the wise words of my
        best friend, my mother`

        contentEn: `I admit it - I did it purely for myself. Well, at first I did it because I’d lost a bet. After my
        best friend completed her ninth Tufts 10K, I bet her that if she would run the Boston
        Marathon, I would run Tufts next time. I posed this idle bet because I never thought
        she’d really do it. Guess what? She did it!<br/><br/>
        Preparing to make good on my wager, I began my training in earnest, and I quickly
        fell in love with the solitude, the fresh air and sunshine, the singing birds, and the capabilities of my thirty-eight-year-old body. During those first few runs, however, I couldn’t shake feelings of guilt about pursuing self-gratification.
        Wasn’t I supposed to be home taking care of my family?<br/><br/>
        My guilt crescendoed when, after one particularly long run, I returned home to soak sore muscles in a leisurely
        hot bath and left my “off-duty ” sign posted a while longer.lying in my Epsom salts, I heard Melissa, my three-year-old,
        whimper, “Where’s Mommy?” My husband distracted her while I gritted my teeth and grasped the sides of the tub,
        torn between the desire for time by myself and the urge to comfort my child. In that moment, I understood that with
        each run, I needed to train not only my body, but - my mind - to allow myself this private time to seek the selfhood I
        was entitled to! Besides, if I were re-energized, I’d be better able to handle the demands of motherhood.<br/><br/>
        Indeed, my two daughters quickly adjusted to my long weekend runs. They ’d casually acknowledge that I was
        leaving. “Going running, Mom?” Gina, my eight-year-old, would ask as she watched me lace up my running shoes.<br/><br/>
        “Have a nice run,” Melissa would add.<br/><br/>
        I’d kiss them and leave, and they ’d be all smiles, knowing this was a chance for them to be alone in the house, while
        Dad worked in the garden, one ear on them. (Mother Nature programmed men with far fewer guilt genes, and women
        are finally taking heed.) Moreover, I think they recognized that I came back from my runs nicer than when I left!<br/><br/>
        Finally, it was time for my first practice race. Off I went with a number pinned to my chest - my heart pounding
        behind it. My family cheered me on from the sidelines, and when I finished the race, they lunged to hug me, despite my
        sweaty body.<br/><br/>
        “Did you win?” asked Melissa. (I couldn’t believe she hadn’t noticed that four million people crossed the finish line
        before me.)<br/><br/>
        “Sorry you didn’t win, Mom,” said Gina. (She’d noticed!)<br/><br/>
        “Girls, I finished!” I proudly announced, briefly explaining that this was a personal victory. Yet even in the
        excitement of my own triumph, I noted with pride that my daughters, at such a young age, accepted as quite natural
        that women can - and should - be winners. When I was a child, the message I got was that nice girls don’t compete.<br/><br/>
        Months later, I successfully completed the Tufts 10K, and instead of abandoning running with this fulfilled
        obligation, I surprised myself and continued.<br/><br/>
        Not too long ago, I ran my third Tufts 10K. Each has been as triumphant as the one before. But that year, the scene
        was more magical than ever. Melissa, then six, wore a running suit her sister bought her with her own money. Gina,
        then eleven and nearly my size, wore my commemorative shirt from my first Tufts 10K.<br/><br/>
        As I ran alongside six thousand other women, I thought of my two most loyal fans - my daughters - awaiting me at
        the finish line. With them was my adoring husband, who admits he gushes with pride when the starting gun fires and I
        run past with the pack. And that year, my best friend, sidelined by an aggravated injury, watched the race with my
        family. No bets necessary : I was running for all of us.<br/><br/>
        As I approached the finish line, my daughters jumped off the curb and ran to meet me. Holding hands, we raced
        the final tenth of a mile together.<br/><br/>
        Afterwards, I stretched my tired legs, wiped my sweaty face and chowed down on snacks. Meanwhile, my
        daughters animatedly and repeatedly announced that several children, including a seven-year-old, had run the race. I
        suspected what was coming.<br/><br/>
        “Can I run with you next year? Can I start training with you now? Can we? Can we?” I heard over and over again as
        I slipped out of my sweaty T-shirt into a dry one.<br/><br/>
        I considered their request: Training with them would mean giving up my time to rejuvenate and be alone amid fall
        leaves, poetic paths and singing birds. Training with them would mean being a teacher, as usual, instead of, for a
        change, the one being taught. However, training with my daughters would also mean that I have helped these two
        future women tackle obstacles, learn skills and take pride in their own accomplishments.<br/><br/>
        “Of course,” I announced. In part, I waged this idle threat because I never thought they ’d really do it, but I knew if
        they would it could only be a positive step for all of us. So we went home and attempted our first mile run together.<br/><br/>
        Guess what? They did it!`

        be on the way out of the house and Mom would look me over and ask in a critical tone,
        “Is that what you’re wearing?” Yes. “Outside of this house?” Yes. “In public?” Yes.<br/><br/>
        “For people to see?” Yes. I knew the drill, but still I would bite. Why, Mom? Do you
        not LIKE my outfit? “No, it’s fine,” she said... “It’s fine,” she SAID. She MEANT: “If you

        on welfare and just out of prison and blame me personally for it, because you know they will... It’s always the

        slow deaths that kind of agony feels like.” I would happily bound out the door and into my day. Yet somehow, in the
        next day I’d find my best torn/shredded jeans staring back at me when I lifted the garbage can lid to drop in a new sack
        of trash. It was always a my stery and I could never figure out exactly how my jeans got there.<br/><br/>
        After high school I went through a period of indecision and searching. I was greatly lacking direction or
        motivation. I was also in dire need of a reality check. I was certain that I would be making tons of money soon with my
        dark and adolescent poetry, that I was on the verge of being discovered for my great talents and brilliance and that I
        would never have to resort to the likes of the desperate masses who did things like working real jobs. So, I would
        ponder and reflect and be a great thinker. So, with no job and no plan, I stayed adrift on my listless journey of finding
        my voice and finding myself for awhile. It was an aimless period. It was a grace period. Of about three days.<br/><br/>
        “All right! I’ve had it.” Mom yelled at me as she slapped my feet right off the coffee table, threw my Twinkie in the
        trash and turned off MTV. (It was all in one continuous fluid motion like a great karate movie or a scene right out of
        Billy Jack. Mom was MAD.) “These are your choices,” she informed me as she dropped a stack of employment
        applications, a community college catalog and an admissions application in my lap. Wow, this was scary. Mom had
        been busy. She had done her homework, the legwork and she even had thrown (right straight at me HARD) a PACK of
        pens. (Black ink, for applications.) She paced and I sat up straight and listened; horrified by this new, aggressive side of
        her I’d never seen. She laid down the law. She was the marshall and I was the outlaw captured in this God-forsaken
        town and she had me. “I will not (It’s how she spoke when I was in really big trouble and she was yelling so loudly all
        her lung capacity was used up in about five to seven words) have you sitting on your lazy BUTT! All day! Everyday!<br/><br/>
        Like you have been! Doing NOTHING ALL DAY! And if you! Are going to! Sit around here! Waiting to get published!<br/><br/>
        You can just leave!” I was sure she was breathing fire. “You can get a job! Like a responsible person! Or you can go to
        school... FULL TIME! But you’re going to do SOMETHING. ALL DAY! DO you understand ME?”<br/><br/>
        Okay, that’s what she SAID. What she MEANT was “Sweetheart I love you. I want you to do better for yourself than
        I did. I don’t want you to have to struggle and swallow your pride and have to work two or three jobs just to make it.<br/><br/>
        You have been given a gift in this world. You’re talented, smart, funny. Please don’t throw all of that away. Please don’t
        disregard opportunities you have that I didn’t have. Just in case the world’s not as quick to notice your greatness as I
        am, I want you to be able to pay your bills in the meantime and to get that piece of paper. I will love you with or
        without a college degree but the world has different standards and you need that paper to have choices. It will be like a
        key that opens many doors. I didn’t get the key or the choices and ended up with whatever doors were left open. Doors
        that I’d have never chosen on my own, had I been given another choice.” (So... I have two associate degrees and
        twelve hours left on my bachelors.)<br/><br/>
        “Did you take your vitamins? What are you having for lunch? Is it low fat? Low cholesterol?” she asked me on the
        phone. And I rolled my eyes. “Yes, Mom! How many years have I been two to you?” She sighed. We were both
        disgusted. “Well, I can’t make you eat right, Donna. And you’re a big girl and if you don’t care about your health, it’s
        none of my business,” she SAID.<br/><br/>
        She MEANT, “No matter how old you get, you’ll always be my baby. And I will always love you, so much that if
        you became unhealthy and something happened to you, it would just kill me. I wouldn’t have you talk to or be friends
        with or remind about vitamins and truly, it would break my heart.”<br/><br/>
        “Hi Mom. How was your day, today?” I ask her as I kiss her on the cheek.<br/><br/>
        “Fine,” she says, “We didn’t really do any thing.”<br/><br/>
        “Well, that’s my favorite day!” I offer, trying to cheer her up (and maybe me). And after a few quiet moments of
        handholding, I ask her, “Are you eating well? They must be treating you well... You look wonderful! So pretty.” I SAID.<br/><br/>
        I MEANT: “How did this happen to you? You’re so frail. And so tired. And I miss you so much everyday. One day you’ll
        be gone and I don’t know what I’m going to do without you. Seeing you this way completely breaks my heart. Will you
        ever know how much I love you?”<br/><br/>
        I crawl into the bed with her and snuggle up. I hold her small, fragile body close. And I brush away her tears as she
        cries. And then I brush away my tears as I cry. And I tell her in soft, whispering, reassuring tones, “Shhhhh... no more
        tears. There’s nothing to cry about.” But she cries and she says, “You’re my littlest angel. I love you so much.” And I
        say, “And, I’m here now so there’s no need to cry! Every thing’s okay. And she settles into my embrace and says she’s
        tired. I kiss her on the forehead as she drifts off into her dreams. And we both say exactly “what we mean. She says,
        “You’re my angel. I love you... and I say, “You’re mine and I love you, too.”`

        landed on a glass rabbit which cut my eye badly enough to blind it. trying to save the
        eye, the doctors stitched the eyeball together where it was cut, leaving a big ugly scar
        in the middle of my eye. The attempt failed, but my mama, in all of her wisdom, found
        a doctor who knew that if the eye were removed entirely, my face would grow up
        badly distorted, so my scarred, sightless, cloudy and gray eye lived on with me. And as I
        grew, this sightless eye in so many ways controlled me.<br/><br/>
        I walked with my face looking at the floor so people would not see the ugly me. Sometimes people, even strangers,
        asked me embarrassing questions or made hurtful remarks. When the kids played games, I was always the “monster.” I
        grew up imagining that everyone looked at me with disdain, as if my appearance were my fault. I always felt like I was a
        freak.<br/><br/>
        Yet Mama would say to me, at every turn, “Hold your head up high and face the world.” It became a litany that I
        relied on. She had started when I was young. She would hold me in her arms and stroke my hair and say, “If you hold
        your head up high, it will be okay, and people will see your beautiful soul.” She continued this message whenever I
        wanted to hide.<br/><br/>
        Those words have meant different things to me over the years. As a little child, I thought Mama meant, “Be careful
        or you will fall down or bump into something because you are not looking.” As an adolescent, even though I tended to
        look down to hide my shame, I found that sometimes when I held my head up high and let people know me, they liked
        me. My mama’s words helped me begin to realize that by letting people look at my face, I let them recognize the
        intelligence and beauty behind both eyes even if they couldn’t see it on the surface.<br/><br/>
        In high school I was successful both academically and socially. I was even elected class president, but on the
        inside I still felt like a freak. All I really wanted was to look like everyone else. When things got really bad, I would cry
        to my mama and she would look at me with loving eyes and say, “Hold your head up high and face the world. Let them
        see the beauty that is inside.”<br/><br/>
        When I met the man who became my partner for life, we looked each other straight in the eye, and he told me I
        was beautiful inside and out. He meant it. My mama’s love and encouragement were the spark that gave me the
        confidence to overcome my own doubt. I had faced adversity, encountered my problems head on, and learned not
        only to appreciate myself but to have deep compassion for others.<br/><br/>
        “Hold your head up high,” has been heard many times in my home. Each of my children has felt its invitation. The
        gift my mama gave me lives on in another generation.

        heart may look for consolation in something more tangible. When I lost my mother, the
        comfort I sought depended on the survival of a single rose.<br/><br/>
        My husband and I are avid rose growers. When we joined a local rose society, we
        became involved in rose competitions where hundreds of blooms of every color and variety are judged for trophies.<br/><br/>
        Growing show roses takes a great deal of time and energy, but the garden was our safe haven where we gladly retreated
        into a world of sunshine and beauty.<br/><br/>
        My mother also loved our yard, and each time she came to our home, she would soon disappear into the garden. I
        often teased her about wanting to visit with the roses more than with us. She had been struggling with progressive
        kidney failure, and the garden was where she went to recover after her exhausting dialy sis treatments. When she was
        strong enough, she would roam through the pathways inspecting and clipping her way around the bushes, since it was
        her self-appointed mission to fill the house with beautiful bouquets. Eventually, when she became too ill to walk
        through the garden, she was content to sit in the shade surrounded by the flowers and birds. By the end of summer she
        had grown very frail, and with a heavy heart I knew this would be her last summer in the garden.<br/><br/>
        An unpredictable complication sent her into a coma, and she suddenly passed away two days before Christmas.<br/><br/>
        After the funeral, I went into the garden hoping to find some comfort in the place she had loved so much. I was
        searching for a sense of her spirit among the roses, but the garden was in its dormant stage and the barrenness
        matched the emptiness I felt in my heart.<br/><br/>
        The following day, some friends from church brought us a new rose-bush in her memory. They had selected one
        called Dainty Bess, a beautiful five-petal rose in cotton-candy pink with dark red stamens and a soft, sweet smell. It
        would be a lovely reminder of mother. We planted the rose-bush near the place where she had spent so many peaceful
        hours, and for me the bush became a symbol of her ongoing spirit. I spent the winter months pampering the little
        plant, urging it to survive and grow strong.<br/><br/>
        The cold rains finally stopped, and an early spring transformed our yard into a riot of fragrant color. Mother
        would have loved it, and I missed sharing her joy and enthusiasm for the garden.<br/><br/>
        Dainty Bess was thriving, covered with bright green leaves and, to our surprise, five long-stemmed buds. When
        the first delicate bloom opened, my spirits soared for the first time in months.<br/><br/>
        Our first rose show was five days away, and I became determined to enter a Dainty Bess bloom in memory of my
        mother’s life, believing this would finally put an end to my grieving. Unusually warm weather had quickly opened
        three of the five buds, so I cut the last two and placed them in the refrigerator to slow the blooming process. The day
        before the show, I tried to force them open by putting them in warm water. The first bud refused to open and simply
        bowed its head, but the last one was perfect I placed it back in the refrigerator and prayed it would survive. Later that
        day, a nagging fear of losing the last rose sent me out to the garden hoping to find another Dainty Bess hiding among
        the leaves, but there was no sign of a bud anywhere.<br/><br/>
        The next morning I opened up the refrigerator to find a bare stem in the vase and five pink petalslying on the
        shelf! I burst into tears. Losing the rose suddenly brought back all the memories of losing my mother. My husband
        gave me a comforting hug. “We’ll enter a Dainty Bess at the next show,” he said soothingly. But I could hear the
        disappointment in his voice.<br/><br/>
        With heavy hearts, we went into the garden to check the rest of the rose-bushes for last-minute blooms before
        leaving for the show. Barely glancing at the Dainty Bess bush as I walked by, a small splash of color caught my eye. My
        gasp of surprise brought Rich rushing over to see what was wrong, and together we stared in disbelief at a single longstemmed, tightly folded bud in the center of the bush. Faith had taught me to believe in miracles but this was beyond
        all understanding. Almost afraid to touch it, I finally cut the stem. In stunned silence, we drove to the show.<br/><br/>
        When we arrived at the exhibit hall, the bud had barely begun to unfurl. I polished the leaves, then cupped my
        hands over the bloom and gave it several warm puffs of my breath to encourage it to open. I knew the rose would be
        disqualified if the petals weren’t fully opened by the time it was judged.<br/><br/>
        After I had done all I could, I stood back and looked at the little rose. Its beauty was breathtaking. Its half-opened
        petals reaching upward reminded me that I had been blessed with an extraordinary act of compassion. Then I realized
        that my competitive spirit had momentarily blinded me to the real reason for showing this rose - not for the prize or
        the glory of winning, but to honor my mother’s life. The rose was perfect just the way it was, and the judge’s opinion
        was no longer relevant. With a grateful heart and a sense of reverence, I placed the rose on the display table and
        walked away, free at last from sorrow’s grip.<br/><br/>
        When the judging was completed, we rushed over to retrieve our special rose. It had disappeared from the table!
        Seeing our confusion, a friend came over and asked if we had looked on the trophy table. There it was - opened to
        perfection, draped with a blue ribbon and standing next to a large silver trophy that said “Best Single-Petal Rose in
        Show.” It was a beautiful and unex-pected tribute to my mother.<br/><br/>
        A few days later, I pressed the rose, hoping to keep it forever as proof that miracles do happen. But when I
        checked it just one week later, it had disintegrated into a fine powder that scattered into the air as I unfolded the paper
        around it. The rose had come into my life to console my aching heart, then vanished as my steriously as it had
        appeared once its work was done.

        named Frank and his wife, Donna, was doctor who worked at a local hospital. Their children, my friend told me, were
        crazy about dogs and missed their old dog tremendously. It sounded like the perfect place.<br/><br/>
        I spoke to Donna on the phone, and she was thrilled about taking Blue. I arranged for my husband to deliver the
        puppy the following day, which was a Friday. Frank gave my husband their address, 412 Adams, and told him that he
        would be home all day, doing work on the house, so my husband should look for ladders in the front yard.<br/><br/>
        The next morning, my husband took Blue and set off in the car. Our sad goodbyes were lightened by the knowledge
        that she was going to a wonderful home.<br/><br/>
        Donna and Frank lived an hour away, on the other side of a big town. My husband found the house; the number
        412 was clearly displayed and there was a ladder in the front yard. Taking the puppy in his arms, he went up to the
        house and knocked on the door. There was no answer. He waited a moment and knocked again.<br/><br/>
        A man in the next yard called over to him, “Who are you looking for?”<br/><br/>
        My husband said, “Frank.”<br/><br/>
        “Oh, Frank went to the hospital,” he said. “I don’t know when he’s coming back.”<br/><br/>
        My husband was irked. Frank had said he’d be home all day. Maybe he’d had to give Donna a ride to work at the
        hospital. But my husband couldn’t wait around. He had made appointments for the rest of the day and had to get going.<br/><br/>
        Something of this must have shown on his face, for the man in the next yard said, “What’s the problem, young fella?”<br/><br/>
        My husband explained his predicament and the neighbor offered to keep the puppy at his house until Frank
        returned. The neighbor had a fenced yard and said it’d be no trouble at all. He was a nice man with dogs of his own, and
        my husband decided it would be all right. He gave the puppy to the neighbor and left for his appointments.<br/><br/>
        The following Monday when I returned to work, my co-worker said to me, “Did you change your mind about
        giving away Blue?”<br/><br/>
        Surprised, I answered, “No. Why?”<br/><br/>
        “Well, Donna told me you never delivered her on Friday. They figured you’d had a change of heart when it came
        time to really say goodbye.”<br/><br/>
        I told her we certainly had delivered Blue. I called Donna and told her about the neighbor taking care of Blue until
        Frank returned.<br/><br/>
        “But Frank was home all day!” she insisted. “And we haven’t heard from any of our neighbors.”<br/><br/>
        What on earth was going on? We finally figured out that my husband had made a wrong turn and had gone to 412
        on the next street over. There had been a storm not long before and many people had ladders out to do roof and gutter
        repairs. Could it possibly be that the man in that house was also named Frank?<br/><br/>
        My husband and I got into the car and drove over to see what had become of Blue. We saw immediately that that
        he’d gone one street too far and we knocked on the door of the house where he’d left Blue.<br/><br/>
        A red-faced man in his sixties answered our knock. When we explained that we were looking for a puppy that had
        been delivered here last week, the man answered, “Oh, you mean the one that Frank ordered?”<br/><br/>
        Realizing that the man at 412 on this street was also named Frank, we explained the mix-up. The man’s face grew
        somber.<br/><br/>
        “What’s wrong?” I asked. “Is the puppy all right?”<br/><br/>
        “Oh, the puppy is fine. In fact, I’m sure the puppy is great. But well, I hope you don’t want it back,” he said
        seriously. Seeing the question in our eyes, he continued, “When you came with the puppy on Friday, my neighbor
        Frank was at the hospital. He’d been out in the yard working and had started having chest pains, so his wife took him to
        the hospital. Frank never did come home. He died of a massive coronary Friday afternoon. It was a terrible shock for
        his family, and I decided not to bother them until things had settled down a bit. Yesterday, I brought the puppy over
        and knocked on their door. Frank’s eldest daughter came out. I told her that her father had ordered a puppy and since
        he hadn’t been home, that I’d taken delivery on it for him. I said I didn’t know what to do with the little dog now that
        ‘things had changed’ at their house.<br/><br/>
        “The daughter just couldn’t believe it. She said, ‘My father ordered a puppy? This is Dad’s puppy?’ Then she
        reached out and I gave her the pup. She hugged that little dog real tight, stuck her face in its fur and just began to cry.<br/><br/>
        “I wasn’t sure what to say, so I just stood there. After a while, she looked up at me and thanked me. She said, ‘You
        don’t know what this means to me. I’m so glad to have my father’s dog.’ The puppy was wiggling around, trying to kiss
        the daughter any way it could and her face was just lit up with love.”<br/><br/>
        Amazed at the story I turned to my husband, “We can’t take Blue back now.”<br/><br/>
        The man nodded in agreement. “Folks, some things are just meant to be. I’d say that puppy is in exactly the right
        place.”

        author: `Linda Bremner`,
        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `Looking back, I’ve often thought the doctors should have written a death certificate for me as
        well as my son, for when he died, a part of me died, too.<br/><br/>
        Andy was almost twelve. For over three years he had been battling cancer. He’d gone
        through radiation and chemotherapy; he’d gone into remission and come out again, not once
        but several times. I was amazed at his resiliency; he just kept getting up each time the cancer knocked
        him flat. Perhaps it was his pluckiness and grit that shaped my own attitude about Andy’s future, or
        maybe I was simply afraid to face the possibility of his death. Whatever the cause, I always thought Andy would make
        it. He would be the kid who beat the odds.<br/><br/>
        For three summers, Andy had gone to a camp for kids with cancer. He loved it and seemed to relish the week he
        could forget about hospitals and sickness and just be a kid again. The day after he returned from his third camp
        adventure, we went to the clinic for a routine checkup. The news was bad. The doctor scheduled a bonemarrow
        transplant two days later in a hospital three hundred miles from our home. The next day we threw our things in a
        suitcase and left.<br/><br/>
        One of the things I tossed into my suitcase was the present Andy had brought me from camp - a plastic sun catcher
        shaped like a rainbow with a suction cup to attach it to a window. Like most mothers, I considered any present from
        my child a treasure and wanted it with me.<br/><br/>
        We arrived at the hospital and began the gruelling ordeal the doctors said was my son’s only chance. We spent
        seven weeks there. They turned out to be the last seven weeks of Andy’s life.<br/><br/>
        We never talked about dying -except once. Andy was worn out and must have known he was losing ground. He
        tried to clue me in. Nauseous and weak after one of the many difficult procedures he regularly endured, he turned to
        me and asked, “Does it hurt to die?”<br/><br/>
        I was shocked, but answered truthfully, “I don’t know. But I don’t want to talk about death, because you are not
        going to die, Andy.”<br/><br/>
        He took my hand and said, “But I’m getting very tired.”<br/><br/>
        I knew what he was telling me, but I tried hard to ignore it and keep the awful thought from entering my mind.<br/><br/>
        I spent a lot of my days watching Andy sleep. Sometimes I went to the gift shop to buy cards and notepaper. I had
        very little money, barely enough to survive. The nurses knew our situation and turned a blind eye when I slept in
        Andy’s room and ate the extra food we ordered off of Andy’s tray. But I always managed to scrape a bit together for the
        paper and cards because Andy loved getting mail so much.<br/><br/>
        The bone-marrow transplant was a terrible ordeal. Andy couldn’t have any visitors because his immune sy stem
        was so compromised. I could tell that he felt more isolated than ever. Determined to do something to make it easier for
        him, I began approaching total strangers in the waiting rooms and asking them, “Would you write my son a card?” I’d
        explain his situation and offer them a card or some paper to write on. With surprised expressions on their faces, they
        did it. No one refused me. They took one look at me and saw a mother in pain.<br/><br/>
        It amazed me that these kind people, who were dealing with their own worries, made the time to write Andy. Some
        would just sign a card with a little get-well message. Others wrote real letters: “Hi I’m from Idaho visiting my
        grandmother here in the hospital...” and they ’d fill a page or two with their story, sometimes inviting Andy to visit
        their homes when he was better. Once a woman flagged me down and said, “You asked me to write your son a couple of
        weeks ago. Can I write him again?” I mailed all these letters to Andy and watched happily as he read them. Andy had a
        steady stream of mail right up until the day he died.<br/><br/>
        One day, I went to the gift store to buy more cards and saw a rainbow prism for sale. Remembering the rainbow
        sun catcher Andy had given me, I felt I had to buy it for him. It was a lot of money to spend, but I handed over the cash
        and hurried back to Andy’s room to show him.<br/><br/>
        He waslying in his bed, too weak to even raise his head. The blinds were almost shut, but a crack of sunlight
        slanted across the bed. I put the prism in his hand and said, “Andy, make me a rainbow.” But Andy couldn’t. He tried to
        hold his arm up, but it was too much for him.<br/><br/>
        He turned his face to me and said, “Mom, as soon as I’m better, I’ll make you a rainbow you’ll never forget.”<br/><br/>
        That was one of the last things Andy said to me. Just a few hours later, he went to sleep and during the night,
        slipped into a coma. I stayed with him in the intensive care unit, massaging him, talking to him and reading him his
        mail, but he never stirred. The only sound was the constant drone and beepings of the life-support machines
        surrounding his bed. I was looking death straight in the face, but still I thought there’d be a last-minute save, a miracle
        that would bring my son back to me.<br/><br/>
        After five days, the doctors told me his brain had stopped functioning, and it was time to disconnect him from the
        machines keeping his body alive.<br/><br/>
        I asked if I could hold him. Just after dawn, they brought a rocking-chair into the room, and after I settled myself
        in the chair, they turned off the machines and lifted him from the bed to place him in my arms. As they raised him from
        the bed, his leg made an involuntary movement, and he knocked a clear plastic pitcher from his bedside table onto the
        bed.<br/><br/>
        “Open the blinds,” I cried. “I want this room to be full of sunlight!” The nurse hurried to the window to pull the
        cord.<br/><br/>
        As she did so, I noticed a sun catcher in the shape of the rainbow attached to the window. I caught my breath in
        wonder. Then, as the light filled the room, it hit the pitcherlying on its side on the bed, and everyone stopped what
        they were doing. They were too surprised.<br/><br/>
        The room was filled with flashes of color, dozens and dozens of rainbows on the walls, the floors, the ceiling, on the
        blanket wrapped around Andy as he lay in my arms - the room was alive with rainbows.<br/><br/>
        No one could speak. I looked down at my son, and he had stopped breathing. Andy was gone, but even in the
        shock of that grief, I felt comforted. Andy had made the rainbows that he promised me - the ones I would never forget.`

        title: `In helping others, we shall help ourselves, for whatever good we give out completes the circle
        and comes back to us`,
        author: `Kathie Kroot`,
        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `With loving tenderness I unpacked my son Joseph’s Little League trophy, his stack of X-Man
        comics and the framed pictures of elephants that had decorated his bedroom walls back in
        our old apartment. Just two weeks before, Joseph had so looked forward to moving into
        his own room in the new house. Now, making his bed, I couldn’t hold back the tears. My
        little boy will never sleep here, I grieved. I’ll never glimpse his smile again or feel his
        loving hug.<br/><br/>
        Wondering how I could possibly manage to go on, I began unpacking the dozens of plush animals Joseph loved to
        collect - bears and monkey s, chipmunks and giraffes.<br/><br/>
        Sitting on his bed, I hugged the Chris Columbus bear he used to nuzzle when he was little and I read Love You
        Forever or another of his favorite stories. Joseph loved books, and to him they were especially precious because he
        had a learning disability that made it all but impossible for him to read them himself.<br/><br/>
        But Joseph was a determined little boy who refused to let his disability stop him from learning. He listened to his
        schoolbooks and tests on tape, and every night we sat together at the kitchen table so I could read his math problems
        to him and help him with his spelling. Joseph worked so hard; he always made honor roll at school. He also earned a
        green belt in karate and was pitcher for his Little League baseball team.<br/><br/>
        In many ways Joseph was just a regular little boy who loved playing video games with his brother, David, or going
        to the movies with his sister, Shalom. But Joseph also knew what it was like to feel different and need a helping hand.<br/><br/>
        I can’t remember how many times I spotted Joseph carrying groceries for our elderly neighbors or refusing
        money after shoveling their cars out from the snow. He loved putting on puppet shows for the little girl down the street
        with Down’s syndrome, and once, when doctors thought his friend Micah might need a kidney transplant, my son came
        to me and said, “I sure wish I could give him one of mine.”<br/><br/>
        Joseph, my little mensch, always made me proud, even on the last day of his life.<br/><br/>
        I was folding clothes in the den that Saturday afternoon when out of nowhere my husband, Lou, shouted for me to
        call 91 1. He and Joseph had been discussing a movie they planned to see when suddenly Joseph collapsed onto his bed
        complaining of a terrific headache. His breathing grew ragged, and then it stopped. Lou, who is a phy sician, performed
        artificial respiration until the paramedics arrived. Then he called ahead to the ER while I rode in the ambulance with
        Joseph and prayed he wouldn’t die.<br/><br/>
        Joseph, always the picture of health, had suffered a massive brain aneury sm. “Is he going to die?” I asked my
        husband. Holding me tightly he answered, “Yes.”<br/><br/>
        It seemed impossible. Only an hour ago my son was home watching TV -and now he was on life support with no
        hope of ever regaining consciousness. I wanted to cry out in shock and grief.<br/><br/>
        But there wasn’t time. There was something important I had to do - and I had to do it right away.<br/><br/>
        “We have to donate his organs,” I told Lou, recalling the time Joseph wanted to give a kidney to Micah. “It’s what
        he would have wanted us to do.”<br/><br/>
        A transplant co-ordinator made all the arrangements, and a few hours later our family gathered at Joseph’s
        bedside to offer a prayer and say our last goodbyes.<br/><br/>
        Then we went home, and throughout that night while surgeons recovered my son’s organs I lay curled on his bed,
        clutching his favorite blanket and telling him how much I would always love him.<br/><br/>
        I don’t know how I survived those next two weeks - the funeral and moving into the house we’d already
        contracted to buy. I cried every time I went near Joseph’s new bedroom - the one he would have loved, if only he’d
        lived. There was a gaping hole in my heart.<br/><br/>
        Then one day when I felt I could bear my grief no longer, a letter came from the transplant co-ordinator. “I am
        writing to share the outcome of your generosity,” I read with tears spilling down my cheeks.<br/><br/>
        Two Kentucky women, one of them the mother of a boy Joseph’s age, were now off dialy sis because they had each
        received one of my son’s kidney s. Meanwhile, in Missouri, cells from Joseph’s liver were helping to keep a critically ill
        transplant candidate alive. In California two young children would soon be able to run and play with the healthy new
        heart valves my son had bequeathed them. And two teenagers, one from Kentucky and the other from New York, had
        regained their eyesight thanks to Joseph’s corneas.<br/><br/>
        Seven people’s lives had been changed dramatically because of my son. I carried the letter with me for days,
        reading and rereading it and marveling especially at the teens who’d received Joseph’s corneas. Joseph’s learning
        disability had prevented him from reading. But because of his very special gift there were now two more children in
        the world who could. Somehow, this helped me understand that my son had not lost his life in vain.<br/><br/>
        I wanted each and every one of Joseph’s recipients to know who he was. So one night I wrote them each a letter
        and told them all about the little boy who had given them the ultimate gift. I asked the transplant agency to forward
        the letters to all seven recipients. With each I sent along one of his beloved stuffed animals and a copy of a school essay
        that he’d once written describing how to take care of them.<br/><br/>
        Knowing the good my son had brought into the world made it easier to walk past his room without bursting into
        tears. It helped the rest of the family, too, and eventually we became able to share happy memories of Joseph around
        the dinner table and at other family gatherings.<br/><br/>
        Lou and I also honored Joseph’s memory by speaking to community groups and high-school students about the
        importance of organ donation. After a TV interview, the mother who had received one of Joseph’s kidneys contacted
        us.<br/><br/>
        “I don’t know how to thank you,” she sobbed the day we first met.<br/><br/>
        “Seeing a part of my son living on is thanks enough for me,” I said.<br/><br/>
        Because of her new kidney, the woman had been able to attend her own son’s eighth-grade graduation. Joseph
        never reached the eighth grade, but instead of begrudging the woman her happiness, I kvelled in it - because it was my
        son who had made this miracle possible.<br/><br/>
        My son is gone, but in a very real way he still lives on, doing what he always did best - offering a helping hand to
        others in need. Some say Joseph’s life was brief. I say it was full.<br/><br/>
        I once heard that if you save a life, you save the world. Well, my son saved five lives and gave the gift of sight to
        two others. What mother could possibly ask any more of her child? What mother could possibly be any prouder?`

        across town when the phone rang. A woman I had never met said she was the mother of a
        seven-year-old boy and that she was dying. She said her therapist had advised her that
        discussing her pending death with her little boy would be too traumatic for him, but
        somehow that didn’t feel right to her.<br/><br/>
        Knowing that I worked with grieving children, she asked for my advice. I told her that our heart is often smarter
        than our brain, and that I thought she knew what would be best for her son. I also invited her to attend the lecture that
        night since I was speaking about how children cope with death. She said she would be there.<br/><br/>
        I wondered later if I would recognize her at the lecture, but my question was answered when I saw a frail woman
        being half-carried into the room by two adults. I talked about the fact that children usually sense the truth long before
        they are told, and they often wait until they feel adults are ready to talk about it before sharing their concerns and
        questions. I said that children usually can handle truth better than denial, even though the denial is intended to
        protect them from pain. I said that respecting children meant including them in the family sadness, not shutting them
        out.<br/><br/>
        At the break, she hobbled to me and said through her tears, “I knew it in my heart. I just knew I should tell him.”<br/><br/>
        She said that she would that night.<br/><br/>
        The next morning I received another phone call from her. I managed to hear the story through her choked voice.<br/><br/>
        She said she awakened him when they got home the night before and quietly said, “Derek, I have something to tell
        you.”<br/><br/>
        He quickly interrupted her, saying, “Oh, Mommy, is it now that you are going to tell me that you are dying?”<br/><br/>
        She held him close, and they both sobbed while she said, “Yes.”<br/><br/>
        After a few minutes the little boy wanted down. He said he had something for her that he had been saving. In the
        back of one of his drawers was a dirty pencil box. Inside the box was a letter written in simple scrawl. It said,
        “Goodby e, Mom. I will always love you.”<br/><br/>
        How long he had been waiting to hear the truth, I don’t know. I do know that two days later Mom died. In her
        casket was placed a dirty pencil box and a letter.

        firstborn son, Seth, celebrated his fourth birthday the day following his mother’s death, and Morgan, our youngest
        boy, would reach his third exactly three weeks later.<br/><br/>
        Liz, who had been a stay -at-home mother, excelled at cooking, housecleaning and all the other domestic chores
        that embellished our lives. In true machocop, chauvinistic fashion, I had taken her generosity for granted, never
        having time to take on any of these responsibilities myself. As a result I found myself suddenly, in the midst of my
        grief, thrust ranting and screaming into the role of maid, shopper, driver, launderer, childcare professional, cook and
        dishwasher. We had moved into a heavily mortgaged new home only weeks before Liz’s death, and our financial
        situation was already precarious. I soon realized that police work, with its rotating shifts, would necessitate a live-in
        nanny. To my great dismay, the constant demands for attention from two preschoolers left me exhausted and
        irritated, until I began to resent their very existence.<br/><br/>
        In the following days, loneliness and pain gave way to anger and, eventually, self-pity. I spiraled deeper and
        deeper into despair, and it wasn’t long before my body began to display its inner turmoil. Despite my efforts to veil my
        grief from the children, my eyes became dark and baggy, my weight plummeted, and on one occasion, the boys
        watched me spill milk all over the table as a quivering hand thwarted my efforts to fill a glass.<br/><br/>
        Although I dreaded the moment, I knew at some point I would have to delve into the task of sorting through Liz’s
        personal effects, cleaning out the closets and boxing up her clothes and other belongings. One evening, the boys
        tucked away for the night, I began. Each dress, that scarf, this pair of shoes, one by one, evoked its treasured, if not
        painful, memory and feelings of overwhelming guilt. It was in a small fold, deep within her purse, that I found almost
        by accident a neatly folded, tiny slip of yellowed paper, its creases, tight and crisp with age, protecting a carefully
        printed message.<br/><br/>
        “Dear Kevin,” it began, “these are all the reasons that I love you...” And as I read on, her words obscured by tears,
        my heart ached and my body shook with convulsive, painful sobs of loneliness. I had hit bottom.<br/><br/>
        In that hopeless fog of despair, I became aware of two small arms wrapped around my legs as I sat at the edge of
        the bed. A small voice asked in all the innocence of his three years, “What’s the matter, Daddy?”<br/><br/>
        “I feel sad, Morgan, that Mommy’s gone to heaven, and we won’t see her for a very long time,” I said, struggling
        vainly for composure.<br/><br/>
        “Don’t worry, Daddy, we’ll help you. When Seth and I get up in the morning, we’ll put the cereal on the table and
        all you’ll have to do is make the toast.”<br/><br/>
        With those few, simple, loving words, my three-year-old child taught me a greater lesson than any other. His
        thoughts were sunlight filtering into the my dreary, winter soul, and I knew at that instant that life would be okay`

        contentEn: `Mama died just days before my eleventh birthday, and my destiny careened
        dramatically from snuggly to loose-ended. Overnight, my childhood vanished. In
        the coming months, Dad met Dot at work and began seeing her regularly. A year
        later, they married.<br/><br/>
        So quickly. Another woman moving into our house stirred anew my still-fresh memories of
        Mama. At the same time, Dot inherited a brood of three children, ages five, eight and twelve.<br/><br/>
        When alone, I listened to an old recording of “You’ll Never Walk Alone,” and I was convinced my mama sang
        those words to me from the other side. Yet in moments of grief I wondered, How can she walk with me now? My
        child’s heart yearned for a mother’s touch.<br/><br/>
        “Do you want the kids to call you Mama?” Dad asked Dot one day. Something in me wanted her to say “Yes.”<br/><br/>
        Dot looked troubled for long moments, then said, “No. That wouldn’t be right.”<br/><br/>
        The no felt like a phy sical blow. Blood’s thicker’n water, came my grandma’s favorite litany. I’d not, until that very
        moment, grasp its meaning. My stepmother’s answer seemed proof that blood was thicker, that I was merely Daddy’s
        “baggage” - proof that, to her -despite the fact that she introduced me as “my daughter” - I was biologically not.<br/><br/>
        I was of the water. So I distanced myself.<br/><br/>
        My sulky aloofness hid a deep, deep need for acceptance. Yet no matter how churlish I became, Dot never hurt me
        with harsh words. We were, in those trying days, quiet and bewildered for harmony.<br/><br/>
        After all, we were stuck with each other. She had no more choice than I.<br/><br/>
        I visited Mama’s grave every chance I got to talk things over with her. I never carried flowers because fresh
        arrangements always nestled lovingly against the headstone, put there, no doubt, by Daddy.<br/><br/>
        Then, in my fourteenth year, I came in from school one day and saw my new member – my newborn baby
        brother, Michael. I hovered over the bassinet, gently stroking the velvety skin as tiny fingers grasped mine and drew
        them to the little mouth. I dissolved into pure, maternal mush. Dot, still in her hospital housecoat, stood beside me.<br/><br/>
        “Can I hold him?” I asked hesitantly.<br/><br/>
        She lifted and placed him in my arms.<br/><br/>
        In a heartbeat, that tiny bundle snapped us together.<br/><br/>
        In a few short months, Dot had become my best friend.<br/><br/>
        At Grandma’s house one Sunday, I overheard Dot tell my Aunt Annie Mary, “I told James I didn’t think it was
        right to force the kids to call me Mama. Irene will always be Mama to them. That’s only right.” So that’s why she’d said
        “no.”<br/><br/>
        Or was it? Blood’s thicker’n water. Was Grandma right? Was that always true in matters pertaining to familial
        loyalty? I shrugged uneasily, telling myself that it didn’t matter anyway.<br/><br/>
        The following years, Dot embraced my husband Lee as “son,” she soothed me through three childbirths, and
        afterward spent full weeks with me, caring and seeing to my family’s needs. Intermittent with these events, she birthed
        three of her own, giving me two brothers and a sister. How special our children felt, growing up together, sharing
        unforgettable holidays like siblings.<br/><br/>
        In 197 4, Lee and I lived two hundred miles away from home when a tragic accident claimed our eleven-year-old
        Angie. By nightfall, Dot was there, holding me. She was utterly heartbroken.<br/><br/>
        I moved bleakly through the funeral’s aftermath, secretly wanting to die. Every Friday evening, I dully watched
        Dot’s little VW pull into my driveway. “Daddy can’t come. He has to work,” she said. After leaving work, she drove four
        hours nonstop to be with me each weekend, a trek that continued for three long months.<br/><br/>
        During those visits, she walked with me to the cemetery, held my hand and wept with me. If I didn’t feel like
        talking, she was quiet. If I talked, she listened. She was so there that, when I despaired, she single-handedly shouldered
        my anguish.<br/><br/>
        Soon, I waited at the door on Fridays. Slowly, life seeped into me again.<br/><br/>
        In 1992, Dad’s sudden auto accident death yanked the earth from beneath me, and I lapsed into shock,
        inconsolable. My first reaction was that I needed Dot.<br/><br/>
        And then, I felt a vague fear in my mind. I’d grown so secure with the Daddy and Dot alliance through the years
        that I’d simply taken family solidarity for granted. Now with Dad’s abrupt departure, the chasm he left loomed murky
        and frightening.<br/><br/>
        Had Dad, I wondered, been the glue?<br/><br/>
        Terrifying thoughts spiraled through my mind as Lee drove me to join relatives. Will I lose my family? The peril of
        that jolted me to the core.<br/><br/>
        Blood’s thicker’n water. If Grandma felt that way, couldn’t Dot feel that way, too, just a little bit? It was in this
        frame of mind that I entered Dot’s house after the accident.<br/><br/>
        Dot’s house. Not Dad’s and Dot’s house anymore.<br/><br/>
        Will Daddy’s void change her? She loved me, yes, but suddenly I felt keenly DNA-stripped, the stepchild of
        folklore. A sea of familiar faces filled the house. Yet, standing in the midst of them all, I felt utterly alone.<br/><br/>
        “Susie!” Dot’s voice rang out. “I’m so sorry about Daddy, honey,” she murmured and gathered me into her arms.<br/><br/>
        Terror scattered like startled ravens.<br/><br/>
        What she said next took my breath. She looked me in the eye and said gently, “He’s with your Mama now.”<br/><br/>
        I snuffled and gazed into her kind face. “He always put flowers on Mama’s grav...”<br/><br/>
        She looked puzzled, then smiled sadly. “No, honey, he didn’t put the flowers on her grave.”<br/><br/>
        “Then who...”<br/><br/>
        She looked uncomfortable for long moments. Then she leveled her gaze with mine. “I did.”<br/><br/>
        “You?” I asked, astonished. “All those years?” She nodded, then wrapped me in her arms again.<br/><br/>
        That truth was so unpredictable. Blood is part water. Grandma just didn’t get it.<br/><br/>
        I asked Dot recently, “Isn’t it time I started calling you Mom?”<br/><br/>
        She smiled and blushed. Then I thought I saw tears spring into her eyes.<br/><br/>
        “Know what I think?” I said, putting my arms around her. “I think Mama’s looking down at us from heaven,
        rejoicing that you’ve taken such good care of us, doing all the things she’d have done if she’d been here. I think she’s
        saying, ‘Go ahead, Susie, call her Mom.’”<br/><br/>
        I hesitated, suddenly uncertain. “Is that okay?”<br/><br/>
        In a choked voice, she replied, “I would consider it an honor.”<br/><br/>
        Mama’s song to me was true: I do not walk alone.<br/><br/>
        Mom walks with me.

        contentEn: `Mommy, would you be sad if I died?” Disturbing words quickly tumbled from the
        mouth of four-year-old Ashley, taking her mother, Kathleen Treanor, by
        surprise.<br/><br/>
        “Of course, I would, Ashley. I’d miss you terribly.”<br/><br/>
        “But don’t be sad, Mommy. I’d be an angel watching over you.”<br/><br/>
        With a play ful wink and a promise to stay close by my side, childish giggles soon filled the air. Yes, every thing was
        back on key, with no more talk of four-year-olds going to heaven before their time.<br/><br/>
        A few days later, Kathleen brought Ashley to Grandma LaRue’s house. Grandma was a wonderful sitter, whose
        home overflowed with love, comfort and joy. Without a doubt, homemade cookies would soon be on their way.<br/><br/>
        After tenderly kissing Ashley goodby e, Kathleen jumped in her car and hurried off to work. She’d hardly arrived
        and settled comfortably in her chair, with a steaming cup of freshly brewed coffee, when she heard it. A huge blast
        rocked Oklahoma City, and just as quickly destroyed her world.<br/><br/>
        Confused and unsure of what happened, a co-worker flipped on the television. Everyone in the office stood in
        reverent shock as the news began to unfold. There’d been an enormous explosion at the Murrah Federal Building.<br/><br/>
        Kathleen could hardly believe her eyes. Not here! She thought. Soon, young mothers were running back and forth in a
        frantic search for their children. Kathleen was horrified to discover there’d been a day care in the building. My God, the
        children, she thought, as she began to pray for the desperate families.<br/><br/>
        Within moments, her sister called with unimaginable news. Luther and LaRue Treanor had taken Ashley to their
        social security conversation, which was inside the Murrah building. Suddenly, the room began to spin. Surreal
        humming filled Kathleen’s ears. Ashley was in that devastated structure - the one she was watching on the news!
        Her mother-in-law and father-in-law, along with Ashley, were found among the dead. Kathleen immediately
        slipped into a deep, dark depression.<br/><br/>
        But months later, Kathleen recalled a prayer she’d uttered just days before the bombing, pleading with God for a
        message of hope to share with a hurting world. Then her mind raced to Ashley’s words just before the explosion, “Don’t
        be sad if I die. I’ll be an angel watching over you.” Suddenly, Kathleen realized she was being prepared for a mission far
        beyond her understanding.<br/><br/>
        Kathleen decided to plant a memorial for her daughter. Today, Ashley’s Garden is adorned with a graceful weeping
        willow, a fountain and an abundance of lively, brilliant flowers. For all who see it, the message is clear. Life goes on.<br/><br/>
        Joy follows sorrow. Light rises from darkness.<br/><br/>
        When Kathleen awoke on the morning of September 1 1, 2001, along with the rest of the world, she froze in
        disbelief. America had, once again, been struck by the evil of terrorism. In that moment, she knew, her words of hope
        and healing would reach far beyond the borders of Oklahoma. They would now take her to New Y ork City.<br/><br/>
        So, along with survivors and victims’ families, she boarded a plane and flew toward her destiny. By meeting the
        Oklahomans, the people of New Y ork were able to see firsthand that time and faith heal all wounds.<br/><br/>
        No one knows what the future holds, but for now, Kathleen’s on a mission, reaching out to the hurting, the
        wounded and to all who grieve with an inspiring message of hope.<br/><br/>
        And back in Oklahoma, Ashley’s Garden still blooms.`

        contentEn: `It had been another long week of conducting training sessions throughout the country. I
        generally like to relax on the flight home, do some easy reading, maybe even close my eyes for a
        few minutes. I try to be open to whatever does happen, though.<br/><br/>
        On this particular day, I boarded the plane and noticed a young boy, around eight years
        old, sitting next to me. I love kids. However, I was tired. My first instinct was, Oh boy, I’m not sure about this. trying
        my best to be friendly, I said “Hello” and introduced myself. He told me his name was Bradley. We struck up a
        conversation and, within minutes, he took me into his confidence, saying, “This is the first time I have ever been on a
        plane. I’m a little bit nervous.”<br/><br/>
        He told me that he and his family had driven to see his cousins, and that he got to stay longer after his family had
        returned home. Now he was flying home, all by himself.<br/><br/>
        “Flying is a piece of cake,” I tried to reassure him. “It is one of the easiest things you’ll ever do.” I paused, thinking
        for a moment, and then asked him, “Have you ever been on a roller coaster?”
        “I love roller coasters.”<br/><br/>
        “Do you ride them without hands?”
        “Oh, y eah, I love to.” He giggled. I acted as if I were horrified.<br/><br/>
        “Do you ever ride in the front?” I asked with a pretense of fear on my face.<br/><br/>
        “Y eah, I try to get in the front seat every time!”<br/><br/>
        “And you’re not afraid of that?”<br/><br/>
        He shook his head no, clearly sensing that he was now one up on me.<br/><br/>
        “Well, this flight will be nothing compared to that. I won’t even ride roller coasters, and I’m not the least bit afraid
        to fly.”<br/><br/>
        A lovely smile edged its way onto his face, “Is that right?” - I could see that he was starting to think that maybe he
        was brave after all.<br/><br/>
        The plane began to taxi down the runway. As we ascended, he looked out the window and began describing with
        great excitement every thing he was experiencing. He commented on the cloud formations, and the pictures they
        seemed to paint in the sky. “This cloud looks like a butterfly, and that one looks like a horse!”<br/><br/>
        Suddenly, I saw this flight through the eyes of an eight-year-old boy. It was as if it were the first time that I had
        ever flown. Later Bradley asked me what I did for a living. I told him about the training that I conduct and mentioned
        that I also do radio and television commercials.<br/><br/>
        His eyes lit up. “My sister and I did a television commercial once.”<br/><br/>
        “You did? What was that like for you?”<br/><br/>
        He said that it was very exciting for them. Then he told me that he needed to go to the bathroom.<br/><br/>
        I stood up to let him out into the aisle. It was then that I noticed the braces on his legs. Bradley slowly made his
        way down to the bathroom and back. When he sat back down, he explained, “I have muscular dy strophy. My sister has
        it too - she’s in a wheelchair now. That’s why we did that commercial. We were poster children for muscular
        dy strophy.”<br/><br/>
        As we began our descent, he looked over, smiled, and spoke in a hushed, almost embarrassed voice, “You know, I
        was really worried about who would sit next to me on the plane. I was afraid it would be someone crabby who didn’t
        want to talk with me. I’m so glad I sat next to you.”<br/><br/>
        Thinking about the whole experience later that night, I was reminded of the value of being open to the moment. A
        week that began with me being the trainer ended with me being the student. Now when times get rough - and they
        inevitably do - I look out the window and try to see what images the clouds are painting in the sky. And I remember
        Bradley, the beautiful child who taught me that lesson.

        contentEn: `The year 1993 was a turning-point in my life. I was into my eighth year as a single parent,
        had three kids in school, my unmarried daughter had just given birth to my first
        grandchild and I was about to break up with a very nice man I’d dated for over two
        years. Faced with all this, I was spending lots of time feeling sorry for myself.<br/><br/>
        That April, I was asked to interview and write about a woman who lived in a small town in
        Minnesota. So during Easter vacation, Andrew, my thirteen-year-old, and I drove across two states to meet Jan Turner.<br/><br/>
        Andrew dozed most of the way during the long drive, but every once in a while I’d start a conversation.<br/><br/>
        “She’s handicapped, you know.”<br/><br/>
        “So what’s wrong with her? Does she have a disease?”<br/><br/>
        “I am not sure. But for some reason, she had to have both arms and legs amputated.”<br/><br/>
        “Wow. How does she get around?”<br/><br/>
        “I don’t know. We’ll see when we get there.”<br/><br/>
        “Does she have any kids?”<br/><br/>
        “Two boys - Tyler and Cody - both adopted. She’s a single parent, too. Only she’s never been married.”
        “So what happened to her?”<br/><br/>
        “Four years ago Jan was just like me, a busy single mother. She was a full-time music teacher at a grade school and
        taught all sorts of musical instruments. She was also the music director at her church.”<br/><br/>
        Andrew fell asleep again before I could finish telling him what little I did know about what had happened to Jan.<br/><br/>
        As I drove across Minnesota, I began to wonder how the woman I was about to meet could cope with such devastating
        news that all four limbs had to be amputated. How did she learn to survive? Did she have live-in help?<br/><br/>
        When we arrived in Willmar, Minnesota, I called Jan from our hotel to tell her that I could come to her house and
        pick her and the boys up, so they could swim at our hotel while we talked.<br/><br/>
        “That’s okay, Pat, I can drive. The boys and I will be there in ten minutes. Would you like to go out to eat first?<br/><br/>
        There’s a Ponderosa close to your hotel.”<br/><br/>
        “Sure, that’ll be fine,” I said haltingly, wondering what it would be like to eat in a public restaurant with a woman
        who had no arms or legs. And how on earth does she drive? I wondered.<br/><br/>
        Ten minutes later, Jan pulled up in front of the hotel. She got out of the car, walked over to me with perfect
        posture on legs and feet that looked every bit as real as mine, and extended her right arm with its shiny hook on the
        end to shake my hand. “Hello, Pat, I’m sure glad to meet you. And this must be Andrew.”<br/><br/>
        I grabbed her hook, pumped it a bit and smiled sheepishly.<br/><br/>
        “Uh, yes, this is Andrew.” I looked in the back seat of her car and smiled at the two boys who grinned back. Cody,<br/><br/>
        the younger one, was practically effervescent at the thought of going swimming in the hotel pool after dinner.<br/><br/>
        Jan bubbled as she slid back behind the driver’s seat, “So hop in. Cody, move over and make room for Andrew.”<br/><br/>
        We arrived at the restaurant, went through the line, paid for our food, and ate and talked amidst the chattering of
        our three sons. The only thing I had to do for Jan Turner that entire evening was unscrew the top on the ketchup
        bottle.<br/><br/>
        Later that night, as our three sons splashed in the pool, Jan and I sat on the side and she told me about life before
        her illness.<br/><br/>
        “We were a typical single-parent family. You know, busy all the time. Life was so good, in fact, that I was seriously
        thinking about adopting a third child.”<br/><br/>
        My conscience stung. I had to face it - the woman next to me was better at single parenting than I ever thought
        about being.<br/><br/>
        Jan continued. “One Sunday in November of 1989, I was playing my trumpet at the front of my church when I
        suddenly felt weak, dizzy and nauseous. I struggled down the aisle, motioned for the boys to follow me and drove
        home. I crawled into bed, but by evening I knew I had to get help.”<br/><br/>
        Jan then explained that by the time she arrived at the hospital, she was comatose. Her blood pressure had
        dropped so much that her body was already shutting down. She had pneumococcal pneumonia, the same bacterial
        infection that took the life of Muppets creator Jim Henson. One of its disastrous side effects is an activation of the
        body’s clotting sy stem, which causes the blood vessels to plug up. Because there was suddenly no blood flow to her
        hands or feet, she quickly developed gangrene in all four extremities. Two weeks after being admitted to the hospital,
        Jan’s arms had to be amputated at mid-forearm and her legs at mid-shin.<br/><br/>
        Just before the surgery, she said she cried out, “Oh God, no! How can I live without arms and legs, feet or hands?
        Never walk again? Never play the trumpet, guitar, piano or any of the instruments I teach? I’ll never be able to hug my
        sons or take care of them. Oh God, don’t let me depend on others for the rest of my life!”<br/><br/>
        Six weeks after the amputations as her dangling limbs healed, a doctor talked to Jan about prosthetics. She said
        Jan could learn to walk, drive a car, go back to school, even go back to teaching.<br/><br/>
        Jan found that hard to believe so she picked up her Bible. It fell open to Romans, chapter twelve, verse two:
        “Don’t copy the behaviour and customs of this world, but be a new and different person with a fresh newness in all
        you do and think. Then you will learn from your own experience how his ways will really satisfy you.”<br/><br/>
        Jan thought about that - about being a new and differrent person - and she decided to give the prosthetics a try.
        With a walker strapped onto her forearms near the elbow and a therapist on either side, she could only wobble on her
        new legs for two to three minutes before she collapsed in exhaustion and pain.<br/><br/>
        “Take it slowly,” Jan said to herself. “Be a new person in all that you do and think, but take it one step at a time.”<br/><br/>
        The next dayshe tried on the prosthetic arms, a crude sy stem of cables, rubber bands and hooks operated by a
        harness across the shoulders. By moving her shoulder muscles she was soon able to open and close the hooks to pick
        up and hold objects, and dress and feed herself.<br/><br/>
        Within a few months, Jan learned she could do almost every thing she used to do - only in a new and different way.<br/><br/>
        “Still, when I finally got to go home after four months of phy sical and occupational therapy, I was so nervous
        about what life would be like with my boys and me alone in the house. But when I got there, I got out of the car, walked
        up the steps to our house, hugged my boys with all my might, and I haven’t looked back since.”<br/><br/>
        As Jan and I continued to talk, Cody, who’d climbed out of the hotel pool, stood close to his mom with his arm
        around her shoulders. As she told me about her newly improved cooking skills, Cody grinned. “Y up,” he said, “She’s a
        better mom now than before she got sick, because now she can even flip pancakes!” Jan laughed like a woman who is
        blessed with tremendous happiness, contentment and unswerving faith in God.<br/><br/>
        Since our visit, Jan has completed a second college degree, this one in communications, and she is now an
        announcer for the local radio station. She also studied theology and has been ordained as the children’s pastor at her
        church, the Triumphant Life Church in Willmar. Simply put, Jan says, “I’m a new and different person, triumphant
        because of God’s unending love and wisdom.”<br/><br/>
        After meeting Jan, I was a new and different person as well. I learned to praise God for every thing in my life that
        makes me new and different.<br/><br/>
        Jan may not have real flesh-andblood arms, legs, hands or feet, but that woman has more heart and soul than
        anyone I’ve ever met before. She taught me to grab on to every “new and different” thing that comes into my life with
        all the gusto I can muster... to live my life triumphantly.`

        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `My father died a few months before his thirty-eighth birthday. I was fifty-three at the
        time. How could I be fifteen years older than my own father? Because the most
        important birth date our family celebrated was Alcoholics Anonymous birthday.<br/><br/>
        I have thought a lot about what it means to me to have grown up in a family that
        simply didn’t work long before the term “dy sfunctional family ” was coined. When I was little, I
        learned lessons that helped me survive at the time. I am still unlearning some of those early lessons.<br/><br/>
        Last summer, while working in the garden, I shifted a large stepping stone over onto a patch of grass and forgot to
        return it to its place. When at last I remembered to move it, the grass underneath was sickly pale and stunted. The
        grass still lived, and with time, water and the sunlight it needed to survive, it grew healthy. Had I left the stone there,
        the grass would have died and been replaced by grubs, snails and bare earth.<br/><br/>
        Parts of me are like a lawn where stones have been scattered at random. Some patches didn’t get what they needed
        to grow strong and healthy. While finding and moving those stones, I have often been resentful and I angry. There are
        spots where grass will never grow. It hurts to admit there were things I just didn’t get when I was a little kid.<br/><br/>
        But in the course of all that work, I have come to appreciate how much sunshine did fall on me, and even how to
        grow plants more exotic than grass in the bare spots. And for the first time in my life, I wish I could remember more.<br/><br/>
        I’ve tried to remember how I felt in 1958 when Daddy stopped drinking. Instead, I wasn’t even aware of what was
        going on. And when I did begin to realize something unusual was happening, I was skeptical, even cynical. No
        expectations for me! I had been sadly disappointed too many times before. Even in the beginning, my family was I wise
        enough to realize that stopping one particularly destructive behavior doesn’t mean instant cures, only freedom to
        work on the deeper issues that inevitably underlie “The Problem.” So nobody ever promised any thing that I
        remember. I wouldn’t have believed them if they had.<br/><br/>
        As months went by, I slowly suspected change was possible. Then one night, as my mother and I were driving
        home, we saw my father’s beat-up old blue panel truck parked at the neighborhood bar. I knew it was all over. Mother
        said, “I have to go see.” She parked the car and left me sitting outside while she went inside. Through a window I could
        see Daddy, leaning against the bar, a tall, ambercolored glass in his hand. Every thing inside me went into a protective
        crouch -deep, dark and hidden away.<br/><br/>
        Mother came out of the bar with a strange new expression on her face. She climbed into the car and said, “He’s
        drinking iced tea. He needed to check up on some of his old friends. He’ll be home in a little while.” Something inside
        me was able to relax a little.<br/><br/>
        After Daddy’s best birthday, by God’s grace, and thanks to Daddy’s hard work, he never did “fall off the wagon.”<br/><br/>
        Following the Alcoholics Anonymous slogan “one day at a time,” he and mother truly lived one day at a time, working
        on their problems and helping other people through A.A. Daddy never became financially successful, and sometimes
        he said how sorry he was that he had no inheritance to leave his children. But he didn’t brood over lost opportunities.<br/><br/>
        When he turned eighty, he joined a fitness club and worked out on the weight machines to improve his golf swing.<br/><br/>
        Then at an A.A. retreat, he fell and broke his hip. He and Mother fought his deteriorating condition for three years.<br/><br/>
        A big man, and always phy sically fit, Daddy hated the indignities of not being able to walk or care for himself. Slowly,
        slowly his body shut down, and with Mother and a few other family members by his bed, he died. Later, Mother said,
        “He can walk again. And I know he walked into heaven clean and sober.”<br/><br/>
        At my parents’ fiftieth wedding anniversary some years before his death, the reception hall was filled with
        children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, nieces, nephews, cousins and hundreds of friends from A.A. and church.<br/><br/>
        How clear that memory is. How different it would have been if he had not been brave enough in 1958 to ask for help.<br/><br/>
        Daddy was wrong to think he had nothing to leave his children. He gave us over thirty-seven years and nine
        months of sobriety - almost fourteen thousand days -one day at a time. His courage is his legacy, our inheritance`

        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `A little boy smiled although he was within an octopus of tubes and electrodes that
        measured his every breath and all his vital signs. He looked up and said, “My IV is out,”
        sending a student scurrying down the hall to the nurse’s station. A little girl at the
        corner of the room lay quiet in her bed. Her tiny bald head peered through the hospital
        rails at the visiting students. “I have cancer,” she whispered.<br/><br/>
        In addition to their illnesses, the children in this hospital had one more thing in common: the need for medical
        supplies and services that their insurance companies would not cover. That afternoon, a routine tour of the hospital
        for thirteen college students became a project as we realized these kids needed more than our visits.<br/><br/>
        We called ourselves the “Dream Team.” We spent the next year planning a thirty two-hour dance marathon that
        would raise the money. In the face of the courage and energy shown by these kids, no one could see thirty-two hours
        of nonstop dancing as too much of a task. We had no problem collecting over three hundred student volunteers to plan
        the event. Our goal was five thousand dollars, and we were sure we would meet it.<br/><br/>
        Each sorority, fraternity, residence hall and student organization “adopted” the family of a sick child. The families
        were embraced on almost monthly visits to football games, and dinners in the cafeteria. The students followed their
        child’s health and made frequent trips to the hospital. The children were given love and the hope that they might be
        able to go to college themselves one day. Students stood at intersections in wind chill, collecting spare change. Faculty
        and staff donated a dollar every Friday for the kids and other donations poured in.<br/><br/>
        A week before the dance began, an urgent plea came from one of the families. Their twin boys had leukemia, and
        one needed a bone-marrow transplant. A donor had to be found, but the process for finding a match was painful and
        costly. Students by the hundreds stood in line to have their blood sampled. No donors were found.
        The dance began at 10:00 A.M. on a cold Saturday morning. Over a hundred dancers filed in the recreation
        center, now transformed into a playground of music and food. Little kids were everywhere in the room, some in
        wheelchairs, some wheeling IVs around, some with only a tiny layer of fuzzy hair on their heads.<br/><br/>
        At the thirty-first hour, the families assembled on stage to tell their stories. Some had children who were too sick
        to attend, some had lost children only days before. A four-year-old clutched the microphone and stood on tip-toe to
        say, “Thank you for raising money to save my life.”<br/><br/>
        Then the parents of the twin boys took the stage. The room fell silent. Exhausted dancers stood up straight. Into
        the hushed room the parents said, “Tonight we are here alone because our son is getting ready to go into surgery
        tomorrow morning. Earlier today a bone-marrow donor was found.” Then they could no longer speak. With tears
        streaming down their cheeks, they said: “Thank you.”<br/><br/>
        Then a group of students assembled on stage holding pieces of poster, each with a number painted on it. Slowly
        they held them up to reveal the total amount that the Dream Team had raised: \$45,47 6.17. The crowd went wild,
        dancers started running around the floor and families were crying. Everyone knew it had been thirty-two hours of
        miracles.`

        contentEn: `There are advantages and disadvantages to coming from a large family. Make that a large
        family with a single parent, and they double. The disadvantages are very apparent when
        someone wants to go to college. Parents have cashed in life insurance policies to cover
        the cost of one year.<br/><br/>
        My mother knew that she could not send me to school and pay for it. She worked in a retail store and made just
        enough to pay the bills and take care of us. If I wanted to go to college, it was up to me to find out how to get there.
        I found that I qualified for some grants because of the size of our family, my mom’s income and my scores. There
        was enough to cover school and books, but not enough for room and board. I accepted a job as part of a work-study
        program. While not glamorous, it was one I could do. I washed dishes in the school cafeteria.<br/><br/>
        To help myself study, I made flash cards that fit perfectly on the large metal dishwasher. After I loaded the racks, I
        stood there and flipped cards, learning the makeup of atoms while water and steam broke them down all around me. I
        learned how to make y equal to z while placing dishes in stacks. My wrinkled fingers flipped many a card, and many
        times my tired brain drifted off, and a glass would crash to the floor. My grades went up and down. It was the hardest
        work I had ever done.<br/><br/>
        Just when I thought the bottom was going to drop out of my college, an angel appeared. Well, one of those that are
        on earth, without wings. I just knew that his name was Jack.<br/><br/>
        “I heard that you need some help,” he said.<br/><br/>
        “What do you mean?” I asked.<br/><br/>
        “ Financially, to stay in school.”<br/><br/>
        “Well I make it okay. But I just have trouble working all these hours and finding time to study.”<br/><br/>
        “Well, I think I have a way to help you.”<br/><br/>
        He went on to explain that his grandparents needed help on the weekends. All that was required of me was cooking
        meals and helping them get in and out of bed in the morning and evening. The job paid four hundred dollars a month,
        twice the money I was making washing dishes. Now I would have time to study. I went to meet his grandparents and
        accepted the job.<br/><br/>
        My first discovery was his grandmother’s great love of music. She spent hours playing on the piano though it was
        old and off-key. One day, she told me that she would teach me the art. My campus had several practice rooms with
        pianos where music majors could practice. I found myself going into those rooms more and more often.<br/><br/>
        Grandma was impressed with my ability and encouraged me to continue. Weekends in their house became more
        than just books and cooking; they were filled with the wonderful sounds of the out-of-tune piano and two very out-oftune singers.
        When Christmas break came, Grandma got chest pains, and I was afraid of leaving her. I hadn’t been home since
        Labor Day, and my family was anxious to see me. I agreed to come home, but for two weeks instead of four, so I could
        return to Grandma and Grandpa. I said my goodbyes and returned home.<br/><br/>
        As I was loading my car to go back to school, the phone rang.<br/><br/>
        “Daneen, don’t rush back,” Jack said.<br/><br/>
        “Why? What’s wrong?” I asked, panic rising.<br/><br/>
        “Grandma died last night, and we have decided to put Grandpa in a retirement home.”<br/><br/>
        I hung up the phone feeling like my world had ended. I had lost my friend, and that was far worse than knowing I
        would have to return to dishwashing.<br/><br/>
        I went back at the end of four weeks, asking to begin the work-study program again. The financial aid advisor
        looked at me as if I had lost my mind. I explained my position, then he smiled and slid me an envelope. “This is for
        you,” he said.<br/><br/>
        It was from Grandma. She had known how sick she was. In the envelope was enough money to pay for the rest of
        my school year and a request that I take piano lessons.<br/><br/>
        Now, years later, when I walk by a piano, I smile and think of Grandma. She is playing the ivories in heaven, I am
        sure.

        contentEn: `In January of 1998, I got the kind of call all actresses hope for: I had
        won the role of Julie Emrick on a new TV drama called Felicity. It
        should have been one of the most exciting moments of my life, but
        three months earlier something had happened that would disorder all.<br/><br/>
        In October 1997, my mom, Christine Johnson, was diagnosed with cancer.<br/><br/>
        Ten months later, she died at age fifty-three, and my life would never be
        the same.<br/><br/>
        My mom was my best friend. She taught me to appreciate everyday. I
        think that is the key to life. I try to keep remembering that, and to make it
        a habit. And when I meet with difficulties, I just think about her.<br/><br/>
        I was like her sidekick growing up in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. My
        brother, Greig Jr., now thirty-three, and my sister, Julie, now thirty-two,
        were both older than me (I’m twenty-nine), so when they started school, it
        was just me and my mom together all day, running errands or just hanging out.<br/><br/>
        We even remained close through my rebellious period. In high school, I was staying out too late, doing the normal
        teenage stuff, so my parents sent me to a private school in New Hampshire. I got kicked out after eight months for
        getting caught in the boys’dorm. Oops! My punishment was having to go to a small local church school. When I did
        something wrong, if I tried to deny it or hide it, my mom would get angry. But if I admitted and apologized, she’d be
        totally cool. She was really fair.<br/><br/>
        She was also super-supportive. Ever since I was a kid, I knew I wanted to perform. She was always my biggest fan.<br/><br/>
        When I decided to move to New Y ork City at nineteen to pursue an acting career, my mom and my dad, Greig
        Johnson, a car salesman, never said, “That’s risky,” or, “Don’t do that.” Two years later, in 1993, I moved to Los
        Angeles and got my first TV role as Kimberly.<br/><br/>
        Every thing was going smoothly until the fall of 1997. My mom’s doctors thought she had cy sts on her uterus that
        had grown and needed to be removed. But what should have been a simple hy sterectomy turned into something far
        worse. Mom already kind of suspected. A couple of days before her surgery, she called me up really frightened and
        said, “Amy Jo, what if I have cancer?” and I was like, “Mom, you can’t say that. No. No. No.” So she went in for the
        operation. They didn’t expect to find cancer, but it was everywhere. A rare type of cancer, it had started in her
        appendix, and by the time the doctors found it, it had spread all over her body.<br/><br/>
        I’ll never forget the moment when my dad called and told me the news. It was Halloween. In shock, I flew back to
        be with my family. I remember sitting up one night with my dad, probably two days after we found out. He told me he
        knew she was going to die. I was like, “No, we’ve got to have hope.”<br/><br/>
        My mom handled the news - and her terminal prognosis - with incredible bravery. That Christmas, which she knew
        would probably be her last, she bought us all tickets to see The Lion King on Broadway in New Y ork. It was really
        emotional because the story is about the circle of life and dying and coming back again. I looked over at my mom
        during the scene where Simba sees his father’s ghost. She had tears in her eyes. But she never broke down in front of
        any of us kids or her friends. I think my dad’s the only one who saw how frightened she must have been.<br/><br/>
        My mom tried different therapies. She also went to a hospital in Washington, D.C., for a surgery the doctors hoped
        might give her more time. My sister and I slept on little cots in her hospital room.<br/><br/>
        But the surgery was a letdown. They opened her up again and said there was nothing they could do. The cancer
        had spread too much. Everyone was trying to help, recommending holistic medicines and special diets. We searched
        on the Internet for any thing that might cure cancer. There are just a million things out there that people are trying to
        sell and tell you. Finally, my mom said, “Stop! I don’t want to try any thing else. Don’t bring me any more crazy teas!”
        That winter and spring, I traveled back and forth constantly between L.A. and Cape Cod. The people at Felicity
        were incredible. A couple of times, they stopped production or rearranged the schedule so I could go home. And the
        producers would send my mom hats and T-shirts and letters saying, “We love your daughter.” I think it was a comfort
        for her to know that I would be taken care of when she was gone.<br/><br/>
        My mom didn’t want to die in a hospital, so hospice workers came to our home in July of 1998. They were great
        because they helped my mom accept the fact that she was going to die. That allowed her to say good-by e to
        everybody. One day, she gathered her favorite jewelry and possessions and had each person she loved come upstairs,
        and she gave every thing away. She gave some people back gifts that she remembered they had given to her, like,
        twenty years ago.<br/><br/>
        She kept her sense of humor until she died. Four days after the doctors had predicted she’d pass away, she was
        sitting in bed and started singing! She looked at my sister and me and jokingly said, “What am I going to do? A woman
        can’t live without her jewels.”<br/><br/>
        She wanted me to go back to work, where they were rearranging production for me, but I told her I was staying
        with her. Finally, she insisted: “This could go on for a month. You have to go.” I said goodby e so many times. I’d hug
        her, kiss her, run downstairs, get in the car and then run back up. I did that, like, seven times. Finally, she said, “Amy
        Jo, this is getting ridiculous. Just go.” It was the hardest goodby e I’ve said or will ever have to. Three days after that,
        on August 19, 1998, she died.<br/><br/>
        My sister called and told me the news. I was motionless for some time. Then, I went to my living room and just sat
        there, and suddenly, I got the most incredible feeling I’ve ever had. It was like my mom was in the room with me. It
        was like she came over and gave me peace, and it made me feel ready to go home for the funeral and be with my dad
        and the rest of the family.

        we became best friends on that first day after he broke a cookie in two and
        with a large grin handed me the smaller half. I thought of him as a

        To my embarrassment, I quickly learned that this 200-pound man-boy liked to shake people’s hands. In spite of
        his ear-to-ear grin, he could be daunting because of being denied when he galloped up to strangers and stuck out his
        large hand in a hearty greeting. It was hard to teach him this behavior was inappropriate.<br/><br/>
        “Stand next to me and do not go up to people,” I spoke tersely. “No one likes it.”<br/><br/>
        “Okay,” he obediently replied, as if he hadn’t a care in the world, and nothing was important.<br/><br/>
        When Trey learned to ride his bike, I watched as he ran off curbs and toppled over about a dozen times. Sighing
        deeply, I would impatiently tap my foot on the sidewalk and tell him, “Dust off and try again!” I assumed I was the
        smart one, the one with all the answers. That was about to change.<br/><br/>
        That summer, while playing in the city’s softball tournament, I was sliding into third base when my cleat caught in
        the ground, pulling my foot to the right and backwards as my body fell forward. My parents, sitting in the bleachers,
        heard two loud cracks. I was rushed to the hospital by ambulance. X rays revealed a broken leg and a foot that was
        totally twisted off my ankle and hanging in my skin. Emergency surgery lasted into the wee hours. A pin was put in
        place to hold my foot to my ankle and screws were inserted in the broken leg.<br/><br/>
        In the early morning, groggy from anesthesia, I awoke to see my father, my mother and Trey at my bedside. He
        waited for me to jump up and do something with him.<br/><br/>
        “Hi!” he grinned as he shoved his hand in my face.<br/><br/>
        “Hi Trey,” I weakly shook his hand. My leg hurt and my mind was dense from pain medication.<br/><br/>
        “Dust off... try again,” he said, repeating what he had heard me sayso often.<br/><br/>
        “I can’t.”<br/><br/>
        ”Okay,” he sweetly nodded and galloped out of my room in search of a hand to shake.<br/><br/>
        “Trey, don’t shake hands,” I whispered. “No one likes it.”<br/><br/>
        Before leaving the hospital, my orthopedic surgeon said I might never regain the same mobility in my ankle -
        mobility essential for a champion sprinter and jumper like me. Not allowed to put weight on my leg for eight weeks, I
        wobbled about on steel crutches. Now Trey was the impatient one. He wanted to go places that I couldn’t manage. He
        sat with his arms crisscrossed over his large belly and stared at me with a pouty face.<br/><br/>
        We read many children’s books and drew pictures, but it was plain to see he was bored. He wanted to go to the pet
        store to see the white mice and motley birds. He wanted to go to the library and count all the books on the shelves. He
        wanted to go to the park and have me push him on the swing. I couldn’t do any of this for a while.<br/><br/>
        Meanwhile I was plagued with questions and self-doubt. Would I be finished with phy sical therapy in time to
        hurdle race? Would I ever run at my capacity again? Would I do well in the 300-meter hurdles, the race I had lettered
        in the previous season? Would it still be my event? Or would the doctor’s prediction be correct?<br/><br/>
        I worked hard at my phy sical therapy. At times, Trey came along to watch me work out and he laughed and
        laughed when he discovered that I could’t move. “No dusting off!” he’d say. How simple life was for him. How
        complicated it had become for me. I tried not to cry in front of him.<br/><br/>
        Finally off my crutches, I pushed myself hard to regain my former mobility. Trey ran laps with me around the
        black tar track at my high school, running slightly askew. Sometimes he tripped over his own feet and fell down hard.<br/><br/>
        “Dust off!” he would tell himself with confidence as he rubbed dirt from his legs and knees. I watched him greet
        each defeat with determination. He never gave up.<br/><br/>
        After many months, I somehow managed to qualify for the 300-meter hurdles. Mom, Dad and Trey sat in the
        stands to cheer me.<br/><br/>
        The starting gunshot split the air. Running, I could feel the tautness in my legs. My legs hit the hard track one after
        the other, in a quick rhy thm. My breathing was even. I could feel some of the other runners around me, next to me,
        passing me, ahead of me. I ignored the rising pain in my foot and ankle as I prayed away the thumping fear taking hold
        inside my chest. On the other side of the track, I ran into a wall of cheers. No time to react or think - just time to run
        and run hard.<br/><br/>
        More runners passed me, then another and another. Over the hurdles they flew easily like birds stepping over
        stones.<br/><br/>
        “Look at that new girl move. Go Tiffany,” I heard someone shout to the other runner. Last year it was my name
        they called.<br/><br/>
        Once I had sailed over the hurdles. Now I felt as if I were pulling myself up and over. Then something shifted
        inside me - I thought of Trey and what he had had to deal with. Suddenly my problems seemed minor. With a new sense
        of determination, I sprang forth. I wish I could say that through a superhuman effort I passed the other runners. But I
        didn’t. In fact, I limped across the finish line, dead last in an event in which I had once set a record. Then I looked up
        into the stands. Trey and my folks stood cheering for me harder than any time I had ever won.<br/><br/>
        As the season progressed I did improve, but I never placed first, second or third. I never set another school
        record. My hopes for a track college scholarship were dashed. Yet I learned a lesson more valuable than any medal.<br/><br/>
        And it was this: “Dust off and try again.” I also learned that courage comes not in the easy times, but when it’s hard to
        go on - when others pass you, regardless of how hard you work. Now I finally understand Trey’s courage, as he shakes
        the hands of complete strangers, risking laughter or rejection.<br/><br/>
        Today, I no longer grieve for the athlete I might have been, or the races I might have won, or the records I had
        hoped to break. I see a world filled with possibilities as I walk down new paths to explore.<br/><br/>
        Now, on Saturdays, when someone stares at us, I pull on Trey’s sleeve. “Go shake his hand, Trey.” My crutches
        gather dust in a musty corner of the garage. In contrast, Trey’s handicap remains fresh as the day he was born. And
        everyday he is braver than I could ever be.

        contentEn: `I was born with a “lazy eye”. Actually, it was never really lazy; it just
        floated around my socket, looking this way and that, until it finally
        settled down in the wrong place. I’ve been plagued with double vision
        ever since.<br/><br/>
        As soon as I learned to crawl, I would smack headfirst into walls,
        tables and chairs. As a toddler I walked like a drunken sailor. I probably
        ran into more walls and doorways than before.<br/><br/>
        At the age of five, I began piano lessons. Learning to read all those
        little black dots posed special challenges. But I persevered, closing one
        eye at a time. In this way I joy fully learned to play such classics as
        “Chopsticks,” “Polka Dot Polka” and the “Sewing Machine Song.”<br/><br/>
        Meanwhile, I ignored the headaches that plagued my practice time.<br/><br/>
        The first time I ever saw a bass guitar, it was hanging on the wall in the local music store, all shiny and supremely
        cool, as if waiting there for me. I sat on the chair to thump out a few notes - and my whole body rumbled with its
        power. It sounded to me like the voice of spirit. I was in love with music at the tender age of thirteen. I studied guitar
        like a mad scientist searching for the answer to life. The headaches continued to bother me off and on, but I decided
        not to give up because I loved the instrument. I knew that I was born to play the bass, though at the time I wasn’t sure
        why.<br/><br/>
        In my freshman year of high school, I began working with someone who knew the band leader at a local polka hall
        and who sat in with the band. He arranged the same privileges for me, and these sessions became a regular part of my
        musical training.<br/><br/>
        But that all changed on a breezy Sunday afternoon in the fall of 197 3. A neighborhood friend had talked me into
        joining an impromptu afternoon football game to even up the sides. I did little for most of the game until a teammate
        tipped the ball as the opposing quarterback attempted to pass. To my surprise, and everyone else’s, the ball floated
        into my outstretched arms. I had never in my life handled the ball in a game and I ran for the sheer joy of it. I grinned
        with delight while everyone stood staring, their mouths agape.<br/><br/>
        The opposing captain was livid. His team was behind and he wasn’t about to stand for a little goofy -eyed kid
        running an interception back for a touch-down – with a weird way. I glanced behind me to see him pounding the turf at
        full speed, gaining fast on me. I ran for my life. If he caught me, I’d end up bleeding in the mud.<br/><br/>
        Aiming to dance in the end zone, I ran madly, wildly, until I hit a patch of slick mud and fell face first to the
        ground. I rolled over, just as his careening hulk reached me. Seem me down, he tried to jump over me but the corner
        of his left heel met the corner of my left eye. I remember the pain, then blackness.<br/><br/>
        When I came to, I noticed something weird - no ghost image, no double vision. My sight was blurred and the world
        was filled with fuzzy shapes. But there was only one of each shape, not two. Carefully, I closed my right eye to see what
        my left eye’s sight was like and the world went dark. That’s when I got scared and started yelling.<br/><br/>
        My friends drove me to the emergency room where a doctor pried my swollen eye open and pronounced it fine.<br/><br/>
        The eyeball itself was intact - only the socket area was destroyed. He squirted some antiseptic goop on me, taped a
        huge bandage over half of the left side of my face and sent me home with a stern note to my parents about the dangers
        of football (especially, I supposed, for a goofy -eyed boy ).<br/><br/>
        I tried to stay home, embarrassed by the bandage, but a friend urged me to play that night. He figured I was sure
        to get major sympathy points.<br/><br/>
        At first I thought I’d actually have an easier time with one eye bandaged. I wouldn’t have to alternate eyes to see
        the music clearly. Then I realized that I couldn’t see my bass at all. Without my left eye, I had to turn my head far
        enough that my right eye could see where my left hand was. But in that position, I couldn’t see the music. This terrified
        me.<br/><br/>
        The bassist for the band was kind to me. Watching me from the buffet line, he saw that something was clearly
        wrong. Setting his plate on the table, he came to the stage. I said, “I can’t see what I’m doing. Without my left eye, I
        can’t keep track of the notes and my bass at the same time. What am I going to do?”
        “Just play,” he replied.<br/><br/>
        “You don’t understand,” I pleaded. “I can’t see!”
        He climbed on the bandstand and sat beside me. “Lane, you don’t need to see,” he promised. “You know these
        tunes - you’ve played them a dozen times.” Pointing a wrinkled finger at my chest, he continued, “You have the music
        inside you. It’s always been there. You know it and I know it. Tonight, let these people know it, too.”<br/><br/>
        For a moment I just sat there. Then something - I don’t know what it was, maybe a mixture of fear and the
        realization of truth - began to swell inside me. He must have sensed this, because he smiled and went on: “God gave
        you a gift, Lane. He’s given you the ability to make beautiful music that makes people happy. Stop worrying. Accept
        that gift and share it with them,” he said, gesturing to the audience.<br/><br/>
        “But I can’t see,” I stammered tearfully.<br/><br/>
        “Close your eyes, Lane. Trust yourself. Do you really think God would give you such a wonderful gift then take it
        back? I promise you - the music is there.”<br/><br/>
        He left me to ponder his words while he ate his dinner. As the other musicians completed their final preparations,
        I looked up and said a short prayer. In that moment, it seemed that a warm, loving feeling bathed me, as if a light were
        shining down, as if God were smiling on me. Taking a deep breath, I brought my gaze back into the room as the
        bandleader counted us off.<br/><br/>
        Hesitant at first, I felt my strength start to grow. By the time we hit the second chorus, I was really digging in. The
        second song was better than the first, and the third continued the upward trend. By that time my eyes were closed but
        I could see the music all the same. Just as promised, it was inside my heart and I realized that the old musician was
        right.<br/><br/>
        That night I learned a new way of playing on faith. All I had to do was open my heart and let spirit guide me. It
        took years of practice to do this whenever I chose. I continued to study and constantly strove to build a bridge of faith
        between spirit, myself and the music.<br/><br/>
        In this, I’ve experienced a measure of success. Some people tell me that I seem lost in the music when I play;
        that’s the greatest kind of compliment I can receive. And they ’re half right: I am definitely inside the music, but I’m not
        lost at all. I’ve never felt so found. I don’t have the words to describe how it feels to be nestled in the arms of spirit,
        wrapped in the blanket of the song, completely removed from the phy sical world.<br/><br/>
        After one particularly Spiritconnected performance not long ago, a friend said to me, “Welcome back, Lane. For a
        minute there, I thought we’d lost you for good. I’ve never seen someone so consumed by music.”<br/><br/>
        I had to smile. “I guess I was born with the music inside me - with this gift of spirit.”

        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `My parents divorced when I was seven years old. This came as
        no surprise to everyone around them. My father had been an
        alcoholic for many years, and it was only a matter of time
        before it took its toll on their marriage. After the divorce, my
        mom remarried and my dad moved to a town about thirty minutes away.<br/><br/>
        By the time I was twelve, I felt stable and even happy. I liked having two
        families.<br/><br/>
        It was around szthis time that my dad was fired from his job of nearly
        ten years. We all knew that it was because of the drinking. We also knew
        that it would be hard for a nearly fifty-year-old man to find a new job. For
        a year and a half he remained unemployed, and his situation seemed more
        and more desperate. He continued to be a big part of my life, though. No
        longer stuck at work, he attended all of my basketball games and kept our
        relationship as strong as it ever was.<br/><br/>
        Finally, he got a job in the next state. In a few months, my father was settled in his new home and job, while I was
        left to try and adjust to life without him. He managed to turn his financial situation around, but I was worried about
        him. He didn’t make any new friends and, when he wasn’t with me, he was in his apartment alone. He seemed lonely.<br/><br/>
        When it was my dad’s weekend to pick me up, he would drive three hours to get me and we would stay in a hotel. I
        loved those weekends together, but as time went on my dad seemed to cancel his time with me more and more
        frequently. He seemed to get a “stomach flu,” and when we did spend the weekend together, he was often in the
        bathroom vomiting. We all noticed how emaciated he had become; his legs were even thinner than mine. But although
        he was phy sically deteriorating, my dad was determined to maintain his relationship with his family. He called his
        daughter everyday.<br/><br/>
        One night my dad didn’t call. I was worried, but my mom calmed me down. We reasoned that he was probably out
        too late to call and didn’t want to wake me. But when he didn’t call the next night either, I was really worried.<br/><br/>
        The next morning, my mom and I decided that we should look into the situation. She told me she would call his
        office and tried to reassure me on the way to school. I felt strange that day laughing with my friends, like I shouldn’t be
        so happy. I had this weird feeling that something bad had happened.<br/><br/>
        When I got home, I immediately asked her what his office had told her. As it turned out, they, too, had not heard
        from him. They got suspicious and went to his apartment to see what was going on. My father never answered the
        door, so they got someone to break in. They found my dadlying on the bathroom floor in a pool of blood. The police
        later said that he had died two days before he was found.<br/><br/>
        After hearing the news, I was in bad shape. I felt like there was no point to life. I took a few days off school and
        spent them looking at photo albums and going through my dad’s old stuff. My father was not a perfect man - sometimes
        he was insensitive, sometimes unfair, sometimes unforgiving or hurtful or unreliable. My father disappointed me a lot.<br/><br/>
        But when I look back at the man my father was, I am not disappointed. My father was only human. He did teach me
        how to throw a ball, to wash a car, to appreciate music, to play golf, to love to read, to argue intelligently, to do
        crossword puzzles, to play the guitar and to be proud of myself. Some children never even get to meet their fathers; I
        was fortunate enough to know mine for fourteen years.<br/><br/>
        My father’s death is now a part of me, embedded deep within me. I am growing stronger everyday. My mother has
        taught me, rather than forget about my father’s problems and struggles, to learn from them. My mother is there
        whenever I need her; her support has been the anchor that has kept me from drifting away.<br/><br/>
        As I place the flowers next to my father’s grave, I say a silent prayer and wait there for just a moment. I recall
        every thing about my dad - the good and the bad alike - and I remember the man my father was`

        contentEn: `I was like any other average ninth-grader. I was active in sports, had
        my circle of friends and got good grades. Until the day I was
        introduced to him. There was something in his eyes that attracted me.<br/><br/>
        Somehow I thought that he needed me, just as much as I needed to be
        loved. After flirting for months, we finally became a couple. We were
        together every single moment from that day on. Slowly, day -by -day, my
        family and friends saw me changing. I was in love.<br/><br/>
        After about two months, however, he started to try to control me and
        even raise his voice to me. I told myself it was okay because he really did
        love me. The first time he ever hurt me, we were skiing with friends and
        had lost each other. When he found me, he said it was my fault. He
        proceeded to push me and call me nasty names, while people just stared at
        us. I ran into the bathroom with my best friend and cried my eyes out. The
        next thing I knew, he was in the bathroom hugging me, overflowing with
        kisses and saying how sorry he was. So I forgave him and put that day in the back of my mind.<br/><br/>
        Things did not go back to normal, though. He became possessive and jealous. He made rules stating I could no
        longer wear my hair down, wear shorts in the summer-time or have any sign of another boy in my room. If another
        boy even glanced at me in school, he would yell at me. My grades dropped, I lost my ambition for sports, I started
        losing my friends, and my family became my worst enemy. I didn’t want to listen to what they thought about my
        relationship or how much I had changed. I cried every single night. He would yell at me or blame me for every thing. A
        couple of times, I tried hurting myself because I felt I wasn’t good enough for him and that there wasn’t any other
        reason to be alive. I tried to justify his rude actions by believing they showed how much he cared about me. As a
        ninth-grader, it made me feel important to be in love and have a boy friend.<br/><br/>
        My parents tried taking me to psy chologist and talked to all my teachers about my relationship. I started skipping
        school. The violence escalated. He tried to choke me on - several occasions, and once he tried to break my arm
        because his brother looked at me in my swimsuit. I felt hopeless and depressed. He had so much control over my mind
        that I could not accept anyone else’s opinion of him. I told myself that they just didn’t understand how much he loved
        me. He only did what he did because he cared.<br/><br/>
        The phy sical abuse continued to get worse. He forced me to do sexual things with him. He also hit, choked and
        pushed me down. He tried drowning me once. Fortunately, I escaped from him before he had the chance to get me
        under the water. He also cut my wrists because his life was in the dumps. This went on for nine months.<br/><br/>
        Finally, my parents took me on a trip for a week. While I was on vacation, he cheated on me, and I built up enough
        courage to break up with him. One night I lay in bed and thought of every thing he had done to me. It was clear what I
        had to do.<br/><br/>
        I spent the last two weeks of summer break trying to get my old friends back before returning to school. When I
        went back to school, he was in my gym class. I was nice to him because I still feared him. When I got up the nerve to
        tell him that it was over for good, he went psy cho, pushed me to the ground and kicked me several times. Nobody
        came to help me. The next day, I discovered an eight-inch bruise on my leg.<br/><br/>
        It took me three days to show the bruise to my parents. To my surprise, after every thing I had put them through,
        they helped me. They took me straight to the police station to file charges. I wanted to just let it go, but I was also
        determined that this should not and could not happen to anyone he “loved” in the future. At home, I continued to
        receive threatening phone calls from him saying that he was going to kill me. He told my parents that he would do it if
        he got the chance.<br/><br/>
        My court experience took over a year and was horribly painful. I found out that he had a violent past and that it
        wasn’t the first time that he had abuse charges brought against him. I was never notified about the final court hearing,
        so it happened without me and, to my knowledge, nothing severe happened to him. The justice sy stem let me down,
        but I chose to go on with my life.<br/><br/>
        I am very lucky to be where I am today. I am nineteen years old, and I have grown and healed a lot. It took me
        over three years to tell my parents every thing that he did to me. My parents and I are very close now. The healing
        process may continue for years to come, but I decide to share my story with other young teens, hoping to help
        prevent this from happening to anybody else. I do not wake up everyday hating him. I feel bad for him, and I know he
        needs help, wherever he is. I have learned to live my life to the fullest and to cherish the people I truly love.`

        But I have a feeling he was a good man. Just conjuring up that picture of him makes me
        feel a bit safer. She never spoke of him. Not since it happened. I think she blames
        herself.<br/><br/>
        The details are difficult. I remember all the wrong parts. I was so young. Was I
        about four when it happened? That sounds right for some reason. I had just turned
        four, and my birthday was a few days before it happened. I think that’s why my mom
        always seems sad around the time of my birthday. But she hides it. Says she’s
        sometimes like that; says that her eyes are watery because of all the dust in the air.<br/><br/>
        That’s what she always said. But I can hear her sometimes in the middle of the night. Tiny, suppressed sobs coming
        from her room.<br/><br/>
        It was springtime. A cool day, I remember, because my mom struggled to get me to zip up my jacket. I hated how
        the zipper cut into my neck. It was morning. I remember the smell of the dew as we walked from the house to the car. I
        remember the gulps of fresh air I took, as if to drink it in. To this day, I find myself holding my breath sometimes, on
        spring mornings, waiting for the bus at the end of my driveway.<br/><br/>
        I don’t remember where we were going, but I knew that wherever it was, we were going to meet daddy there. And
        that made me happy. A light drizzle started as we got on the road. I would watch the little droplets of rain as they
        landed at the top of the window and follow them as they became tinier and tinier and finally disappeared as they
        reached the bottom. It was a game I used to play, and still find myself playing when my mind wanders off on long car
        rides.<br/><br/>
        The droplets got bigger and bigger until it became a full-fledged storm, cascading down on the road. That’s when
        my mother started getting strange look on her face. A determined look, eyes squinting into the fog. And her knuckles
        were white as she gripped the steering wheel. I remember balling up my own little fists to see if they would do the same
        thing. Just as I was studying the way little mountains of bone formed and disappeared as I clenched and unclenched
        my fists, there was a shrieking sound. The car braked and I was pushed forward, just about hitting my head on the
        dash. My mom threw open the car door and ran outside screaming.<br/><br/>
        The next thing I remember was sitting on the sofa at my Aunt Rosa’s house. Aunt Rosa was by my side explaining
        something to me, but I couldn’t understand the words. They didn’t mean any thing. They were just a jumble of sounds
        put together, and I started laughing at how funny she sounded. She held her head in her hands and her whole body
        shook. I tried to explain to her what was so funny. But she just cried. So I shut my mouth.<br/><br/>
        And once more it becomes hazy.<br/><br/>
        It’s funny how I can remember the events leading up to the accident with such amazing clarity, but I don’t
        remember much about the time after it happened at all. I mean, I can remember pieces: feelings, colors, images. But
        nothing that tells a story.<br/><br/>
        There was a lot of black. I remember seeing people crying and my mother sitting on the couch surrounded by
        people I knew to be her friends. The woman sitting next to her was her best friend Carmen. She sat holding Mom’s
        hand. I remember wanting more than any thing to see my dad, but I kept telling myself that he was away on business
        and would come back soon, like he always did.<br/><br/>
        Soon the colors started getting brighter. People weren’t always crying. And we started doing the things we
        normally did. But it wasn’t like before. Mom always looked like she was far away. I’d sing to her, dance for her, play
        with her hair - any thing to try and get her to smile at me the way she used to. Any thing to get more than just a pat on
        the head and that faraway smile. I just couldn’t reach her.<br/><br/>
        Since then I’ve gleaned bits of conversations and can sort of piece together what happened. I mean, I knew my
        dad died in a car accident. But I also knew that there was more to it than that. We had been on our way to pick him up
        at the airport. He went away on business a lot, I remember. But we were running late because of the rain traffic. We got
        there just in time to see the accident.<br/><br/>
        My dad leaning out into the street, waving for a taxi. And as the taxi tried to stop for him, it skidded and ran up
        onto the sidewalk. Hitting him. And my mom saw the whole thing happen.<br/><br/>
        He must have thought we forgot about him, since we were pretty late. And so he would have to find his own way
        home.<br/><br/>
        Just then we pulled up.<br/><br/>
        It was raining too hard. The street was too wet. The taxi’s brakes were in need of a tune-up. So many factors
        figured into his death. But my mom blamed only herself.<br/><br/>
        So really my whole life has been tinged with this unspoken sadness.<br/><br/>
        My mom’s still distant. years and years have passed. I’m about to go off to college. And still, she’s in her own
        prison to which only she holds the key. It’s been just her and me for so long, you’d have thought that maybe we’d have
        formed some sort of bond. Just the two of us. Facing the world together. But no. She’s in her corner and I’m in mine.<br/><br/>
        There have been times when I’ve tried to reach out, like I did when I was little. Times when I’d try and get her to open
        up to me by opening up to her. But there’s just no doing.<br/><br/>
        That’s not to sayshe’s been a bad mother. She’s always provided me with what I needed, working long hours just
        so I could have the luxuries a kid with two parents has. She’s been a good mom.<br/><br/>
        And now it’s time for me to go.<br/><br/>
        We’re on our way to school. Most of my belongings are packed in the back of our van. Mom’s driving and I’m
        listening to Counting Crows album. It’s raining, and I’m watching the droplets of water race to the bottom of the
        window. I feel like it’s my last chance. It’s now or never. And so I say it.<br/><br/>
        “Dad would have been proud of me, don’t you think? Going off to college? All grown up?”
        School’s pretty far away. Driving along what seems like an endless stretch of deserted road, so when the car jerks
        to a stop, we’re in no danger of an accident.<br/><br/>
        My mother turns to me slowly, with tears running down her face. But she’s smiling. At first she just stares into my
        eyes and I’m amazed. She takes my hand in hers and says, “Yes, honey. Daddy would’ve been so proud.” And suddenly
        I realized that I’d never had time to grieve over the loss of my father. I’d spent my whole life grieving over the loss of
        my mom. Somehow losing her was worse than losing my father, because she was still with me. But an empty shell of a
        person. She’s here now. She’s with me. That’s what matters. And she exudes this warmth. This warmth that I’ve felt
        before, but not for a very long time. And suddenly I’m crying, too. Not because I miss my dad and wish he were here
        with me, but because, finally, after all this time, she’s ready to come back to life.

        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `Why do I even try? If there’s one thing I should have learned,
        it’s, try or not, I’ll probably “screw up”. Mom says, “Loni, a
        lady shouldn’t say things like ‘screw up’”. That just proves my
        point.<br/><br/>
        I know, I have so much going for me. Dad brags about my grades, and
        Mom’s proud of the person I am and all my activities. Grandma goes on
        and on about my pretty face. Y eah, too bad about the rest of me, I think
        to myself.
        I’m not, like, big enough to be featured as a man in The Guinness Book
        of World Records, but I am big enough not to like shopping with my
        friends. “How cu-u-u-u-ute!” they squeal over every rack of clothes. They
        know they ’ll fit into any clothes, but I can’t choose any thing until I find the
        largest size.<br/><br/>
        I pretend that clothes don’t matter to me. That explains why everyone stares at my chosen sty le. To me, no outfit
        is complete without a sweater, flannel shirt or sweat-shirt tied around my waist to cover up... oh...every thing.<br/><br/>
        So, when we go to the mall, I’m the designated shopper. You know, like the designated driver who goes to a party
        but doesn’t partake I stand outside the changing rooms to ooh and aah when they emerge for the mirror check. Only
        after a careful inspection do I reassure them that their thighs, legs, waist or bottom do not look too big in that outfit;
        otherwise, it would be taken as insincere.<br/><br/>
        They make me feel ashamed when they hand me a piece of clothing and plead, “Can you see if this comes in a
        smaller size?” Give me a break. Where should I look? The children’s department?<br/><br/>
        I really did screw up, though. Being a self-appointed good sport, I tried out for the volleyball team with my
        friends. Here’s the bad part: I made it.<br/><br/>
        It seems I have a killer serve. We keep winning. This is the first winning season of any girl’s sport in our school’s
        history. Volleyball fever took over, and attendance soared. Just my luck. Jumping around high-fiving while my name
        echoes over the PA sy stem.<br/><br/>
        In our small town, making it to State Finals is news-worthy. Our team was pictured sitting in the bleachers in a “V
        for Victory ” formation. I was the connecting bottom of the “V,” front and center in all my glory.<br/><br/>
        “Loni Leads the Charge to State!” read the headline. Not bad. I didn’t even pretend to protest when Mom bought
        copies for the relatives. I was pleased when the team framed the picture and hung it in the tunnel between our locker
        room and the arena. It soon became our team gesture to blow kisses at our picture every time we passed it.<br/><br/>
        It was the night of the final game, and we had home-court advantage. The series was tied two games to two. I led
        the team’s run for our triumphant entrance. Cheers stormed down the tunnel to meet us. We glanced at the banners
        posted along the walls, taking energy from the words.<br/><br/>
        You GO, GIRLS! YES You CAN! WE’RE #1!<br/><br/>
        We were ready to blow kisses at our picture when shock froze me. Two words were written in red on the glass. Two
        words that totally changed the headline.<br/><br/>
        “Loni THE BULL leads the charge to State!”<br/><br/>
        The horns drawn on my head completed the insult.<br/><br/>
        I felt myself emptying until I wasn’t me anymore. I was nobody. The team bunched behind me.<br/><br/>
        “Who did this?”<br/><br/>
        “Who would be so mean?”<br/><br/>
        Their questions had no answers. They thought they were as upset as I was, but they were wrong. I wasn’t upset at
        all. I was in shock.<br/><br/>
        “So this is the truth”, I thought. “This is who I am.”<br/><br/>
        And all the words around me didn’t heal the hurt because nobody said the three words I needed to hear most:
        “That’s not true.”<br/><br/>
        There was no time to sort myself. The real seemed like a dream, and I couldn’t shake myself awake. The chants of
        “Loni! Loni!” sounded hollow. I let the cheers of the many be muted by the jeers of the few.<br/><br/>
        We won the coin toss for my first serve. Around me the team was pumped and ready to go. I rolled the volleyball
        in my palms and mechanically went into my serving stance. All I could see were the words... THE BULL. THE BULL.
        THE BULL.<br/><br/>
        I tossed the ball up, but before my fist made contact the shout “OLE!” hit me. I stutter-stepped and missed the
        ball.<br/><br/>
        I told myself not to look, but my eyes were drawn anyway. I couldn’t pick out who it was. The team tried to buck
        me up with back slaps and “that’s okay s.” But it didn’t help.<br/><br/>
        I went through the rotations until I was at the net. My concentration scurried between the game and the
        bleachers. When the ball skimmed the air above my head, a loud snorting sound came from the front row.
        “That’s taking the bull by the horns!” someone yelled. The player behind me made the save and set up the ball for
        me to spike. But I wasn’t looking at the ball. I was staring into the faces of the five guys who were mocking me. My
        humiliation only fueled their taunts.<br/><br/>
        “Give me a B, give me a U, give me a double L, too. What’s that smell? LONI! LONI! LONI!”<br/><br/>
        Why didn’t someone shut them up?<br/><br/>
        The coach called a time-out. “Loni, can you get your head in the game?”<br/><br/>
        I shrugged.<br/><br/>
        “Why are you letting a few people who don’t even know you decide for you who you are?”<br/><br/>
        I shrugged again.<br/><br/>
        “Loni, you’re valuable to your team. Unkind words don’t change who you are unless you decide they change you,”
        she said.<br/><br/>
        Sounds good in theory, I thought, but this is the real world.<br/><br/>
        “I’m keeping you in, but if you can’t work through this I’ll pull you.”<br/><br/>
        I nodded.<br/><br/>
        I walked past the boys to take my place in the game.<br/><br/>
        With each step I took, they stomped their feet to shake the floor. I got the point. Very funny.<br/><br/>
        I also had to walk past my teammates, and in spite of my weak showing, they were still rooting for me. “You can do
        it.” “You’re the best.”<br/><br/>
        Something in me gave way. The quote on my grandma’s refrigerator popped into my thoughts: “God don’t make
        no junk.”<br/><br/>
        I knew what I knew, and I knew myself - I wasn’t junk. I felt my value from the very depths of my soul. Who was I
        anyway? What did some immature boys know about me? There were so many people who loved and supported me,
        and it was time to do my best for them and for myself.<br/><br/>
        And just like that, I was free of them. Oh, they continued to stomp their feet with each of my steps. I didn’t like it,
        but it didn’t matter. They were powerless over my life.<br/><br/>
        The game was close, and we played hard. The winning serve fell to me. It was my moment, and I took it. The ball
        went up, my fist came forward and hit it right on. It was a perfect power serve unreturnable by the other team. The
        crowd went wild. The pep band started beating out our school song. The team huddled around me.<br/><br/>
        Shouts of “Loni! Loni!” vibrated the arena. The funny thing is, the cheers didn’t feed me like they used to. They
        were great, but the joy I felt, the freedom I felt, the sense of myself I had filled me more than any cheers.
        There was more than one victory that day, and the game was not the most important one.

        title: ``,
        author: `Jenny Hungerford`,
        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `It began when I was eleven. My family and I had just moved to a new
        town. Making new friends was never difficult for me before, but I was
        going through an awkward stage, and I was feeling self-conscious
        about my appearance. I was having a hard time reaching out to meet
        new people. So when I saw some kids smoking, I figured if I could join
        them for a cigarette I could meet some poten-tial “friends.” We hung out
        and smoked everyday. Before long I was introduced to other kids, and
        eventually I started drinking. Soon, drugs and alcohol became my friends,
        too. A few years later, I was using cocaine and running away from home.<br/><br/>
        The first time I ran away I was thirteen. I had come home late one
        evening, and my mom was still up. She saw me sitting in a friend’s car in
        front of our house. She was pretty strict about me being in my friends’
        cars. I was so stoned, and I knew at that point I couldn’t go into my house,
        so I left with my friend.<br/><br/>
        After that night, over the next year and a half, I ran away twenty-three times. I managed to come back every time,
        but within twenty four hours I’d leave again. I was so hooked on drugs that I was afraid if I stayed at home, I wouldn’t
        be able to get the drugs I wanted and needed so much.<br/><br/>
        I would stay at friends’ houses until their parents figured out what was going on. Instead of returning home, I
        chose to live on the streets with friends or by myself. In colder weather, basements of apartment complexes became
        my source for shelter.<br/><br/>
        My mom didn’t know why I was running away. I didn’t communicate with her. She obviously knew something was
        wrong, but she just couldn’t figure out what it was that was causing me to leave home. She tried putting me in some
        treatment centers. During the first treatment center visit, I told her what was going on.<br/><br/>
        When I returned home from treatment I was off drugs, but after a few weeks I started using again. I continued this
        pattern for a while, having relapse after relapse. Finally, my mom quit her job to dedicate all of her time to helping me.
        I went through three more short-term treatment programs, each one lasting only eleven to fourteen days. Each
        time, I was sincere about wanting to quit drugs, but I didn’t know how. I felt like I didn’t have enough time in those
        brief programs to learn how to live my life without drugs. By then, I was battling an eating disorder as well.<br/><br/>
        When I turned fourteen, my mom decided I needed long-term treatment. In my state, at fourteen you’re allowed
        to legally deny medical treatment. So when my mom wanted to put me into a six-to-nine-month treatment program, I
        refused. I was at the lowest of lows in my life at that point. I had already overdosed on peyote and, not knowing how to
        turn my life around, I looked at suicide as my only way out. I just didn’t know how another treatment centers were
        going to help me.<br/><br/>
        Finally, my mom and I took our battle to court. She told the judge about my past, my drug use and that I was an
        addict. The next day he placed me in a treatment center. I haven’t been stoned since that day, five and a half years ago.<br/><br/>
        The treatment center was like a big family. We would go to school for half the day and then receive intensive
        counseling. Prior to my admittance to the center, I had been using cocaine heavily, so I went through withdrawals.<br/><br/>
        The real turning point in my recovery happened when I met someone my own age who really wanted to quit. She
        kept telling me, “Help me, and I’ll help you.” That moved me so much, and it still moves me when I think about it.<br/><br/>
        Having a peer say, “Hey, you can do it,” made me want to do it this time.<br/><br/>
        I also met a woman in a Narcotics Anonymous meeting who had a major impact on me. She stood up and started
        talking about what was going on in her life. I remember watching her and thinking that she glowed. It’s hard to
        describe, but for some reason she just glowed. Every thing about her life was okay now, even the parts she was not
        happy with. I remember looking at her and thinking, I just want to be a little bit shiny. I don’t need to glow, but just
        shine a little. That day I decided I was going to do every thing in my power to live a healthy life.<br/><br/>
        Wanting something and following through with it were two completely different things for me then. After I finished
        treatment, we moved again. I was turning fifteen, and I knew that before long everyone at my school would find out
        about my past. I was going to be in the same position I was in when I was eleven, with no friends, only this time I
        couldn’t use drugs to help me make them.<br/><br/>
        I was so determined not to make the same mistake that I sought help from my guidance counselor right away. I
        told her that I didn’t trust myself not to slip back into my old lifesty le. She surprised me by asking me to tell my story
        to fifth and sixth graders. I told her I had never spoken in front of people before, but she assured me that I would do
        just fine.<br/><br/>
        I was really scared about sharing my past with a bunch of strangers, so I asked my mom if she would join me. We
        sat down that evening and planned the presentation. We had our first heart-to-heart since I was ten years old.<br/><br/>
        We did two presentations at an elementary school, and they made the front page of all the local newspapers.<br/><br/>
        Suddenly, schools were calling us. I was surprised. I couldn’t believe people wanted me to come to their schools and
        talk, that they considered me to be somebody who could help other kids.<br/><br/>
        I realized that doing these presentations helped boost myself-esteem and confirmed for me that I never wanted to
        do drugs again. The thought that I might be helping to save someone’s life or preventing other kids from getting
        involved with drugs made me feel stronger.<br/><br/>
        My mom and I still speak at schools and treatment centers together. Kids call me at home sometimes after our
        talks. Some thank me. Some share their own stories. Some even tell me that I shine - and that is the best part of all.

        contentEn: `I’m awakened by the sound of voices arguing in the garage. Rolling over, I squint
        my eyes at the alarm clock, realizing it’s only five in the morning. I recognize the
        two voices as my mom and dad’s. I hear my father’s voice rising as my mom’s
        darts around in hy steria. I’m familiar with this sickening duet, only just not at this
        early hour.<br/><br/>
        I recall a conversation I had with my dad and realize its implications are just now
        taking effect. Last week at McDonald’s, he shared a secret with me that would forever
        change my life. He began by asking if I was happy with the way things were at home. I
        knew he was referring to the tension that existed between him and my mom. It’s not
        that I was happy with the way things were, but I was frightened by the thought of
        divorce.<br/><br/>
        Divorce is rampant among my friends’ parents, and although I knew that it was
        inevitable that we three would soon join the group, this was one club I did not want to
        be a member of.<br/><br/>
        He was sharing this loaded secret with me - a secret I never wanted to hear. He was telling me that he’d be leaving
        my mother, all the while assuring me that he’d always be there for me. I found myself nodding my head as if I
        understood, when all along I really didn’t. He told me they hadn’t been happy for a very long time, and I’m thinking, If
        you’re both not happy, why the big secret? Why isn’t Mom here sharing this awful moment?<br/><br/>
        He hugged me in an awkward kind of bear hug, and I got all stiff to his touch. Scratching his nose, he informed me
        that he wasn’t ready to tell my mom he was leaving just yet. I asked him when he was going to tell her, and he closed
        his eyes while sighing, “When the moment’s right.”<br/><br/>
        So for two weeks now, I have stared into my mom’s eyes, while never revealing the secret. I am betraying her just
        like my dad is. I try to convince myself that the conversation at McDonald’s never really happened at all.<br/><br/>
        Now, as I lie in bed listening to my mom’s muffled cries, I realize that the moment has arrived. Although my mom
        and I have not always confided to each other about a lot of things, such as dating, school, friends, life... right now my
        stomach is aching for her. Each of her sobs shoots through me like a dart piercing my chest. The agony is so great that I
        finally understand what a broken heart must feel like.<br/><br/>
        I shuffle out of bed and quietly make my way down the long hallway towards the garage from where the voices
        seem to be coming. I open the door slightly enough to see but not be seen.<br/><br/>
        The scene being played out by my parents makes me want to burst out crying. My mom is holding on to the
        bottom of my dad’s leather jacket. She is straining to hold him back, so that he won’t leave her. This is not the proud
        woman who once refused to accept my grandmother’s financial help back when my dad first lost his job. Her face is
        red, awash in tears, and her nose runs while she howls in pain. She has no pride; he is taking it with him.<br/><br/>
        He grabs his coat from her and pushes her back with one hand. He tells her it’s over...” It’s been over for a very
        long time, and we both know it.”<br/><br/>
        She howls again, and through her wailing I hear her moaning, “No, no, no, no.” And then suddenly her tone
        changes to one of anger as she screams, “You are just going to sneak out in the night... aren’t you?... You’re a child...<br/><br/>
        You have no backbone, you coward... I hate you, you pig!” She’s still not letting go of her grip on his jacket.<br/><br/>
        He pulls away from her, and she’s left holding only his jacket in her hands. He tossed his valise into the open door
        of our family van. Then he gets behind the wheel and, without another word, he backs up out of the road and out of our
        lives forever.<br/><br/>
        Now all that’s left is the echo of her tortured cries. I’m not worried about the neighbors hearing what went on.<br/><br/>
        They ’re used to the sound of my parents’ wars. We don’t know what shame feels like anymore.<br/><br/>
        As my mom leans against the wall wailing in spasms of anguish, all I can think of is what I did to cause this. Was it
        because I talked back to my mother that time, when we were out having a nice family dinner? She got so angry with
        me, and I remember my dad told her not to lose her cool and that I was right. Her frozen glance suggested that she did
        not at all like this friendly alliance my dad and I had formed. There was screaming and yelling and people were staring,
        but my parents didn’t seem to care. Next thing I knew, my dad stormed out of the restaurant for the refuge of the car.<br/><br/>
        That was always the pattern: an argument followed by my dad retreating to some remote corner. My mother
        turned to me that night as we sat alone at our table for three and said, “Please don’t destroy my marriage. I don’t think
        I can live without him.”<br/><br/>
        I felt sorry for her now and wondered whether I was the driving wedge between my parents. I was always Daddy’s
        little girl, and in order to please him, I always faced to my mother. My mom described our relationship as black and
        white. If she said yes, I said no; if she said fat, I said thin.<br/><br/>
        I closed the garage’s door and headed back to my room. Once inside, I pressed my forehead against the windowpane, hoping his car would be coming back. Maybe it was all a bad dream and soon I’d wake up.
        Then I felt her hand touch my shoulder. My rival, my sparring partner, took my head in her hands and turned it
        towards her. She wasn’t crying anymore, yet I could still feel the wetness of her tears. There were no words spoken
        between us that morning. For once, we both felt the same thing. We were in agreement in our grief. And now we were
        left with one chair empty at our table for three.`

        contentEn: `My first year of high school felt awkward. After leaving primary
        school at the head of my class, it felt strange starting over as a
        freshman. The school was twice as big as my old school, and to
        make matters worse, my closest friends were sent to a different
        high school. I felt very isolated.<br/><br/>
        I missed my old teachers so much that I would go back and visit
        them. They would encourage me to get involved in school activities so
        that I could meet new people. They told me that in time I would adjust and
        probably end up loving my new school more than I had my old one. They
        made me promise that when that happened I would still come by and visit
        them from time to time. I understand why they said that, but I took some
        comfort in it nonetheless.<br/><br/>
        One Sunday afternoon not long after I had started high school, I was
        sitting at home at our dining-room table doing homework. It was a cold and windy fall day, and we had a fire going in
        our fireplace. As usual, my tabby cat waslying on top of all my papers, purring loudly and occasionally swatting at my
        pen for entertainment’s sake.<br/><br/>
        She was never far from me. I had rescued her when she was a kitten, and somehow she knew that I was the one
        responsible for giving her “the good life.”<br/><br/>
        My mother kept stoking the fire to keep the house nice and warm. Suddenly, I smelled something strange, and
        then I noticed smoke pouring in through the seams of the ceiling. The smoke began to fill the room so quickly that we
        could barely see. Groping our way to the front door, we all ran out into the front yard. By the time we made our way
        outside, the whole roof was engulfed in flames and it was spreading quickly. I ran to the neighbors to call the fire
        department, while I watched my mother run back into the house.<br/><br/>
        My mother then ran out of the house carrying a small metal box full of important documents. She dropped the
        case on the lawn and, in a crazed state, ran back into the house. I knew what she was after. My father had died when I
        was young, and I was certain that she was not going to let his pictures and letters go up in flames. They were the only
        things that she had to remember him by. Still I screamed at her, “Mom! No!”<br/><br/>
        I was about to run in after her when I felt a large hand hold me back. It was a fireman. I hadn’t even noticed that
        the street had already filled with fire trucks. I was trying to free myself from his grasp, yelling, “You don’t understand,
        my mother’s in there!”<br/><br/>
        He held on to me while other firefighters ran into the house. He knew that I wasn’t acting very coherently and that
        if he were to let go, I’d run. He was right.<br/><br/>
        “It’s all right, they ’ll get her,” he said.<br/><br/>
        He wrapped a blanket around me and sat me down in our car. Soon after that, a fireman emerged from our house
        with my mom in tow. He quickly took her over to the truck and put an oxygen mask on her. I ran over and hugged her.<br/><br/>
        “She’s going to be okay,” said the fireman. “She just inhaled a little smoke.” And then he ran back to fight the fire
        while my mother and I sat there dazed. I remember watching my house burn down and thinking that there was nothing
        I could do about it.<br/><br/>
        Five hours later, the fire was finally out. Our house was almost completely burned down. But then it struck me... I
        hadn’t seen my cat. Where was my cat? Much to my horror, I realized that she was nowhere to be found. Then all at
        once it hit me - the new school, the fire, my cat - I broke down in tears and cried and cried. I was suffering loss.<br/><br/>
        The firemen wouldn’t let us go back into the house that night. It was still too dangerous. Dead or alive, I couldn’t
        imagine leaving without knowing about my cat. Regardless, I had to go. We piled into the car with just the clothes on
        our backs and a few of the firemen’s blankets, and made our way to my grandparents’ house to spend the night.<br/><br/>
        The next day, Monday, I went to school. When the fire broke out, I was still wearing the dress I had worn to
        church that morning, but I had no shoes! I had kicked them off when I was doing my homework. They became yet
        another casualty of the fire. So I had to borrow some tennis shoes from my aunt. Why couldn’t I just stay home from
        school? I was totally embarrassed by every thing. The clothes I was wearing looked weird, I had no books, and my
        backpack was gone. I had my life in that backpack! The more I tried to fit in, the worse it got. Was I destined to be an
        outcast and a geek all my life? I didn’t want to grow up, change or have to handle life if it was going to be this way. I just
        wanted to curl up and die.<br/><br/>
        I walked around school like a zombie. Every thing felt surreal, and I wasn’t sure what was going to happen. All the
        security I had known, from my old school, my friends, my house and my cat had all been ripped away.<br/><br/>
        When I walked through what used to be my house after school that day, I was shocked to see how much damage
        there was - whatever hadn’t burned was destroyed by the water and chemicals they had used to put out the fire. The
        only material things not destroyed were the photo albums, documents and some other personal items that my mother
        had managed to rescue. But my cat was gone and my heart ached for her.<br/><br/>
        There was no time to grieve. My mother rushed me out of the house. We would have to find a place to live, and I
        would have to go buy some clothes for school. We had to borrow money from my grandparents because there were no
        credit cards, cash or even any identification to be able to withdraw money from the bank. Every thing had gone up in
        smoke.<br/><br/>
        That week the rubble that used to be our house was being cleared off. Even though we had rented an apartment
        nearby, I would go over to watch them clear away debris, hoping that my cat was somewhere to be found. She was
        gone. I remember every mornings when I would disturb her and get out of bed, she would tag along after me, climb up
        my robe and crawl into my pocket to fall asleep. I was missing her terribly.<br/><br/>
        It always seems that bad news spreads quickly, and in my case it was no different. Everyone in high school,
        including the teachers, was aware of my plight. I was embarrassed as if somehow I were responsible. What a way to
        start off at a new school! This was not the kind of attention I was looking for.<br/><br/>
        The next day at school, people were acting even more strange than usual. When I was getting ready for gym class,
        people were milling around me, asking me to hurry up. I thought it strange, but after the past few weeks, nothing would
        surprise me. It almost seemed that they were trying to shove me into the gym - then I saw why. There was a big table
        set up with all kinds of “stuff” on it, just for me. They had taken up a collection and bought me school supplies,
        notebooks, all kinds of different clothes. It was like Christmas. I was overcome by emotion. People who had never
        spoken to me before were coming up to me to introduce themselves. I got all kinds of invitations to their houses. Their
        genuine outpouring of concern really touched me. In that instant, I breathed a sigh of relief and thought that things
        were going to be okay. I made friends that day.<br/><br/>
        A month later, I was at my house watching them rebuild it. But this time it was different - I wasn’t alone. I was with
        two of my new friends from school. It took a fire for me to stop focusing on my feelings of insecurity and open up to all
        the wonderful people around me. Now I was sitting there watching my house being rebuilt when I realized my life was
        doing the same thing.<br/><br/>
        While we sat there planning my new bedroom, I heard someone walk up to me from behind and say, “Does this
        belong to you?” When I turned around to see who it was, I couldn’t believe my eyes. A woman was standing there
        holding my cat! I leapt up and grabbed her out of the woman’s arms. I held her close to me and cried. She purred
        happily. My friends were hugging me, hugging the cat and jumping around.<br/><br/>
        Apparently, my cat had been so freaked by the fire that she ran over a mile away. Her collar had our phone
        number on it, but our phones had been destroyed and disconnected. This wonderful woman took her in and worked
        hard to find out whose cat it was. Somehow, she knew this cat was loved and sorely missed.<br/><br/>
        As I sat there with my friends and my cat curled up in my lap, all the overwhelming feelings of loss and tragedy
        seemed to diminish. I felt gratitude for my life, my new friends, the kindness of a stranger and the purr of my beloved
        cat. My cat was back and so was I.`

        corner of a garage... somewhere, we all have a box of mementos - pieces of memories
        saved to preserve time gone by. Mine is a small varnished pine box with brass hinges
        that I made in my seventh-grade wood shop class. I have a lifetime of childhood
        memories carefully stored there: my first-aid merit badge from Scouts, a brightly
        colored miniature abacus that was a stocking stuffer from my ninth Christmas, a ticket to a Giants
        game, and the two photos.<br/><br/>
        I’ve had many friends so far in my busy life. Calvin and Allen were two good friends from long ago, but they play
        an important part in my life now, even more than in those distant times. Every few years, I drag the step stool to the
        highest shelf in the garage and rummage for the pine box. There, between my secondgrade report card and a poem
        written by a high school girlfriend, are the two photos of Calvin and Allen.<br/><br/>
        They both had so much in common, even though they lived on opposite sides of town. Both came from loving
        families, with parents proud of their accomplishments. Their everyday was filled with the challenges of school, but
        both were excellent students. They each shared a love for sports, too. In the photo of Allen, he’s standing barefoot on
        the sidewalk in front of my house, with bat poised, waiting for my sister to pitch the ball. It’s easy to see his total
        concentration, even though his face is contorted in attempts to see into the bright July sun. Calvin’s game was tennis.<br/><br/>
        Although we were both on the school’s junior varsity team, he was a much better player than I could ever hope to be.<br/><br/>
        They were both friends, and (in a way ) they were my heroes.<br/><br/>
        The last similarity between the two had the greatest impact on their lives and the lives of their families: both
        became entangled in drug addiction. They must have shared a common fear, a common pain, a common feeling of
        hopelessness and helplessness - not just them, but their families, because the families shared the pain of their sons’
        deaths. My friend Allen died of a heroin overdose at twelve years old. Calvin never saw his twentieth birthday.<br/><br/>
        Neither would ever experience the satisfaction of looking into the eyes of their bride... or the nervousness of
        holding the first baby in the delivery room... or their son’s game-winning double, their daughter’s practiced role in the
        dance recital.<br/><br/>
        So periodically I bring out the box, dust off the two photos and hope. I hope that somehow I’ve learned the magic
        formula needed to prevent history from repeating itself with the two children that mean every thing to me. I know it
        takes more than love, but I’m not sure I know the answer. But then, Calvin and Allen’s parents have asked the same
        question many times. For those of us left, we can only hope that we can make a difference`

        contentEn: `My memories while still in my play -pen are the clink of ice in a highball glass and the taste
        of green olives. My mother was a beautiful, vivacious woman but by the time I was a
        toddler, a dozen years into their marriage, my father left, and she was defeated and
        dispirited.<br/><br/>
        When I was old enough to use the phone, I would call him for reassurance, frightened by my
        mother’s drinking. We experimented with spending a couple of weeks together each summer. And
        on one memorable trip he spent so much money trying to win me a giant stuffed panda bear. The carneys felt sorry for
        him and gave it to us.<br/><br/>
        By the time I turned ten, we had given up our feeble attempts at trying to have a relationship. No matter how hard
        I tried, I was never able to say good-by e without a flood of tears, leaving both of us feeling emotionally raw. I blamed
        myself for chasing him away.<br/><br/>
        As I entered my teens, my mother married a violent alcoholic who used his fists freely and often. There were no
        child welfare agencies or domestic abuse hotlines in those days. What went on between a husband and wife was no
        one’s business and the kids were collateral damage. My mother was beaten often, once badly enough to be
        hospitalized. I came home from school to discover the aftermath. I cleaned up the blood, threw away the broken
        pieces, did my homework and went to bed.<br/><br/>
        My stepfather spent a few days in jail and went through the motions in rehab after which they reunited and we
        moved. I suppose we were all so desperate to feel something, pain was acceptable. Consequently nothing changed.<br/><br/>
        One late summer evening, another argument ensued. I listened from my room for the signs that would tell me
        where on the Richter scale this one would fall. The sound of crashing glass and a blood-curdling scream brought me
        into the living room where my stepfather began coming toward me. Something had snapped and when our eyes made
        contact I knew I was next. I turned, opened the front door and ran. A police car was heading toward the apartment;
        lights flashing and sirens wailing. I went the other way.<br/><br/>
        I would be fourteen in a couple of months, we had just moved to another state and I had no idea where I was. I
        wasn’t enrolled in school yet, had no friends, no money, only the clothes I was wearing. But I knew one thing with
        every fiber of my body : that I wasn’t going to live like that any longer. If my mother had chosen that for her life, it was
        her life and she could live it.<br/><br/>
        I stopped running as I came to the busy main highway. I started walking. Within a few yards I came to a phone
        booth and it occurred to me I should let someone know what had happened. I stepped inside and placed a collect call
        to a number I hadn’t dialed in a long time. As I heard my father’s voice say “Hello,” it was all I could do not to hang up.<br/><br/>
        Already in a hyper state of anxiety, hearing his voice overwhelmed me.<br/><br/>
        In a matter of seconds I was fighting back feelings I had suppressed for years. Why couldn’t he have saved me
        from all this?<br/><br/>
        My dad was hard of hearing so I had to shout. “Dad, it’s me. I need your help, I don’t know what to do.” I began to
        explain what had just taken place and rushed to finish before I completely lost it. I would not cry; that had driven him
        away once and I would never do it again. I could feel my heart pounding. My hands were shaking and clammy and my
        knees were barely holding me up. I was hyperventilating and felt nauseous.<br/><br/>
        All I wanted to hear was, “Okay it’ll be all right,” but from the other end of the phone, what he said was, “Theresa, I
        can’t help you...” and that was all I heard. I hung up the phone with so much force I thought I broke it, slammed the
        phone booth door open and started walking. I don’t know how far I went before I spent all the emotion - miles and
        years, it turned out.<br/><br/>
        When I was finally numb I knew I had to think. It was then I remembered we had ended up moving to that area
        because a close friend of my mother’s lived nearby. She was listed in the phone book and I placed another collect call.<br/><br/>
        A few days and phone calls later my father knew I had found a place to stay and the friend interceded on my behalf
        to convince my mother I was better off not living with her any longer. There turned out to be a few strings attached
        with the new living arrangement but nothing I wasn’t prepared to live with. I started my sophomore year of high
        school a week before Thanksgiving, found a job and stayed out of trouble.<br/><br/>
        For almost thirty years I put that part of my life behind me, having virtually no contact with anyone in my family
        until one day, the phone rang. Someone had tracked me down through an old friend who knew where I worked. My dad
        was dying.<br/><br/>
        From then on I tried to spend much time with my father. One afternoon as we sat quietly in the small living room
        of the rowhouse where he was born and raised, I told him that I was sorry for all the time we had lost. I explained that
        there was very little in my life I would change, even the worst parts that broke my spirit and my heart.<br/><br/>
        I could tell from the look in his eyes there were many regrets, more than we had time to make up for, and that he
        didn’t have the energy to do this now. We sat silently and let the moment pass.<br/><br/>
        After a rest he reached for my hands, holding them in both of his, and closed his eyes. “You were my little girl and
        I didn’t help you,” he began softly. “I knew things were bad for you, but in those days kids stayed with their mothers.”<br/><br/>
        He opened his eyes and breathed deeply before continuing.<br/><br/>
        “But look how you turned out. You took care of yourself. You have people in your life who love you and protect
        you.” Tears traced their way down his cheeks to be lost in the stubble of his chin.<br/><br/>
        “That night you called, I felt so helpless. I was hours away and I couldn’t help you. I was going to try to calm you
        down and figure out what to do until I could get there, but...”<br/><br/>
        I don’t know what more he said. I was suddenly a terrified little girl again, trying to be brave in a phone booth
        hearing him say, “... I can’t help you...”<br/><br/>
        An overwhelming sense of grief washed over me as I realized that my rashness in hanging up that phone had
        sentenced my father and me to a lifetime of estrangement.<br/><br/>
        I buried my face in his lap and cried like the baby he had left so many years ago. He stroked my hair and patted my
        back. He became my father that day, and I, his little girl. I can’t say how long we stayed that way, but it felt like a
        lifetime - at the very least, a childhood.<br/><br/>
        He died a few weeks later, but during the time we had been together it was never difficult to say the few words that
        could have made such a difference so many years ago, “I love you.” “I forgive you.” “It’ll be all right.”`

        critical step in my recovery. “My recovery.” This was still a new concept to me with just
        over a week in treatment for drug and alcohol addiction. My assignment was to write a
        letter to someone important in my life about my addiction and to commit myself to
        recovery.<br/><br/>
        I knew instantly that I had to write the letter to my parents. For years I watched their confusion at the chaos in
        my life. Somehow I had been able to hide my drug habit so all they saw were the consequences. But now, the cat was
        out of the bag. They were at a loss to understand why, of their seven children, only I had invited drugs and alcohol into
        my life. The other members of my family led normal, happy, successful lives - lives I envied but could not seem to
        emulate. At the many family gatherings I felt like an outsider, living a lie, dreading the day anyone discovered my
        awful secret. I was the last to arrive and the first to leave, anxious to be alone with my pipe.<br/><br/>
        In this assignment I would meet my worst fear head-on. Finally my parents would know the awful truth about
        their worthless daughter. Before I could begin I actually prayed. For years I believed God would have nothing to do
        with me. Now in my deepest heartbreak I asked for his strength and love. Then I wrote the letter. Of course after
        writing it I had to give it to them.<br/><br/>
        Little did I know that on the day I chose to share my letter, my mother had prayed for me again. She gave me up
        to God, told God I was in his hands. Her concerns for me and for my little boy were killing her. She just could not worry
        about me another day.<br/><br/>
        I drove up to their lovely home. I walked in the front door and found my parents in the cozy family room with my
        sister Deidre. I asked them all to sit down. Then I took out my letter and read it to them.<br/><br/>
        June 1997<br/><br/>
        Dear Mom and Dad,<br/><br/>
        Hi, it’s me your long-lost daughter. God, I have missed you these past fifteen years - you and Wendy, Deidre,
        Shari, Dean, Randy and Daren.<br/><br/>
        I suppose the best way to break this to you would be to sit quietly while I let you read the contents of this first
        assignmentand then watch your hearts break while mine disintegrates with more guilt and shame.<br/><br/>
        You did everything right. You have six wonderful kids to prove it and yet I am such a loser. I have often wished
        you would discover that I was not your child after all. That would at least explain my worthlessness.<br/><br/>
        It is 3:21 in the morning and I am sober - for eight days now. And I am determined to finish this letter as part of
        my first assignment and part of a series of steps toward my recovery. I dread telling you about me but I know it will
        answer so many questions for you. You always say how much you miss me. I could not figure out just what, exactly,
        you missed. Of your seven children, I let you down the most. “You have so much potential.” Mom, you have said that
        more times than I can remember. I hope you are right.<br/><br/>
        I am so tired of being alienated from you all. I miss you so-so-so much. I feel as though my happiness stopped in
        1977when Dad held me so tight in my little dormitory room at my university. I’ll never forget the look of love and
        regret in your eyes, Dad, the day you left me there. And I’ll never forget my own grief, how I cried at watching you
        leave.<br/><br/>
        I am sorry for the pain my choices have caused you. I am sorry for the agony my revelations will cause you
        now. You have always been there for me, when I asked and even when I couldn’t. You have loved me
        unconditionally and that is what makes hurting you now so hard. My only prayer is that in this hurt, true healing
        will finally begin.<br/><br/>
        I do so want to please you again. I so much want to be part of my family again. I do not want to be an addict -
        on drugs -anymore, ever again. But I am so afraid of failing. You know I never tried much anymore because that
        way I could not fail. But this is my greatest challenge. And if I fail the only answer for me is death. So I have to
        succeed. I will always be an
        addict in recovery and I wonder, can you live with that label? Is this just too much?<br/><br/>
        I need to know you still love me. But I am so afraid. I suppose I am afraid of losing you. But I lost you long ago in
        my addiction. So maybe, I really have nothing left to lose by sharing this with you. I will do this, Mom and Dad, for
        my son. Yes, a drug addict has raised him - until now. And I will do this for you, and I will do this for me, in the hope
        that indeed I am worth it.<br/><br/>
        I love you more than life, far more than life. I even love you more than death. And, that is something because I
        have longed for death for so long. Yes. I love you more than death and I want “My Recovery” more than death. And
        it means I have a chance. If I can just know you are there my recovery is only a matter of time, work, God and me.<br/><br/>
        Pray for me. And pray for all that potential. I am gonna need it. I’ll keep you posted.<br/><br/>
        All my love,<br/><br/>
        Tracey
        My parents moved closer and closer to me. Deidre got up and held me. At the end we were all holding each other,
        crying and hurting. But through the tears we all tasted hope and I knew without a doubt that I would have all the love
        and support from my parents and my brothers and sisters. I had been so afraid of their judgment and rejection.<br/><br/>
        Imagine my surprise the following Saturday when my entire family - my parents, brothers, sisters, their spouses
        and children and my son - showed up at my treatment center in a massive show of support and love.<br/><br/>
        That was nearly seven years ago. The love and encouragement has never wavered. Today I am fully enmeshed in
        my family. I belong. I have a wonderful job working for Health and Social Services. I am the Chair of RAFT (Recovering
        Advocates for Treatment), an organization that speaks out about the importance of treatment for drug and alcohol
        addiction. I am active in my church and community.<br/><br/>
        My relationship with my fourteen-year-old son is incredible. He is a 4.0 student, wise, centered and
        compassionate. I am there to guide him, to love him and to be a light in his world.<br/><br/>
        So, once again my mom was right... I do have potential. And everyday in my recovery, I live with it`

        their mistakes if they weren’t
        so busy denying them`,
        author: `Steven Manchester`,
        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `It was an ordinary Saturday at Fenway Park in Boston. The streets were exploding with hoots
        and hollers. A closer look, however, revealed that no one was engaged in conversation. Men
        and women alike kept their eyes either on the ground before them, or focused straight ahead.<br/><br/>
        Then I saw him. An elderly man was sitting alone on a stoop. Curious, I wandered over for a
        better look. A shiver traveled the length of my spine. Unfortunately, the temperature was not
        the cause of the horrible sensation.<br/><br/>
        Amidst a flowing river of Nikes and Timberland boots, the nameless man wore shoes that had
        worn through long ago. Dressed in threadbare rags, he held a silver coffee can in one trembling
        hand and his sign in the other. It read: Hungry Korean War Vet. As if already dead, the man’s yellowed eyes, sunken
        deep in his head, belied years of alcoholism and a gray tinge painted his somber face. I was reminded of my own
        sacrifices made for my country in Operation Desert Storm. At that time, I thought that my stomach might actually kick
        up the two hot dogs I’d just devoured.<br/><br/>
        People circumvented the man as if he were a leper. Not one person stopped to help. Obviously, it was easier to
        assume the man was a con artist than to find the truth in his tormented eyes. I somewhat understood. There were still
        many truths people did not want to know. In this case, that truth only defined a cold and uncaring society.<br/><br/>
        Other passers-by went above and beyond apathy. They were mean enough to leave behind an insult, or a laugh to
        stab the poor man’s heart. The vet was too old and weary to strike back at the masses. Each time a harsh word was
        offered him, his eyes closed briefly and then opened again as if he’d completely absorbed the cruelty.<br/><br/>
        Fifteen endless minutes elapsed and although the coffee can remained empty, I witnessed a fellow human being
        suffer too much embarrassment and humiliation. Whatever dignity remained was greedily and brutally stripped away
        by those who, somewhere along the line, were hardened and left blind.<br/><br/>
        Suddenly, another unfortunate soul captured my attention. It was another elderly gentleman; this one, confined
        to a wheelchair. The man slowly approached a curbstone, and then worked his chair back and forth in an attempt to
        clear the lip. It was no use. Determination and effort were quickly replaced by frustration and mumbled curses.<br/><br/>
        Through it all, hundreds of patriotic baseball fans herded around him and proceeded on to their different ways. I stood
        paraly zed with shock.<br/><br/>
        As the numbness wore off, I took two steps to assist, but was one step too late. The homeless man placed his sign
        and empty cup on his stoop and went to help another who needed help more. My eyes filled. There was still some good
        left in the world. Strangely enough, it always seemed to come from those who were in desperate need of what they
        themselves gave so selflessly. The two shared a genuine smile, which apparently only those in need could understand.<br/><br/>
        The pauper returned to his stoop between the judgmental gaze of a million cruel eyes. I stood amazed. The same chill
        returned down my spine.<br/><br/>
        After placing a crisp twenty-dollar bill in the beggar’s can, I received a nod for my generosity, and then a tap on
        the shoulder. My brother Randy’s raised eyelids told me that he didn’t approve.<br/><br/>
        During the lengthy ride home, I explained the tragic scene and the topic led to some unusually deep discussion.<br/><br/>
        We traveled a good distance in silence. I decided that as long as my own intentions of helping were pure, then I
        didn’t see any risk of injury to anyone. The odds seemed better. Besides, it was one of society’s problems that more
        people should be taking personally. With thousands being swallowed up by substance abuse, alcoholism,
        unemployment and homelessness each day, it could have easily been anyone sitting on that same lonely stoop. Then,
        placing myself in that man’s shoes, l only hoped that someone would be kind enough to take a chance on me rather
        than the state’s lottery.<br/><br/>
        Reaching Fall River, Randy broke the silence with a very innocent question. Though he expected no answer,<br/><br/>
        Randy asked, “Steve, don’t you ever wonder why God has given so much to so few, and so little to so many?”<br/><br/>
        Surprised that my brother’s thoughts mirrored my own, I smiled. The answer seemed so easy, so obvious. To
        Randy’s surprise, l responded sincerely, “I think that God has given enough. The problem is that people have forgotten
        how to share his generous gifts!”<br/><br/>
        Needless to say, the rest of the journey was driven in silence, the Boston Red Sox continued to lose and
        somewhere on a very cold stoop a needy man sat alone`

        contentEn: `If there was anyone less likely to become my mentor, it was Smilin’ Jack. He was a janitor
        who had left decades of drunken turmoil in his wake. Yet, by the time we met, Smilin’ Jack
        had transformed his life and radiated with the joy of living.<br/><br/>
        Raised in the mountains of North Carolina, there was little evidence that any thing but a
        difficult future lay in Jack’s path. His formal education ended in the third grade. His father and
        most of his relatives worked in the local sawmill and it was assumed that he would do the same. The only other option
        was working with the moon-shiners. By the time he was a young teen, Jack had discovered the easy money of running
        corn liquor. Unfortunately, he also developed a taste for that liquid and became his own best customer. One fall
        evening, in a car filled with corn squeezings, unable to escape the pursuing revenuers, he was arrested. Sentenced to
        prison, he spent several years shackled at the ankles, working on a chain gang. Not surprisingly, the days and months
        of humiliation served only to increase his anger and bitterness at the world.<br/><br/>
        On his release, determined to escape the boredom of his hometown, he joined the merchant marines. Working
        aboard cargo ships, he traveled the world. Yet, lost in a haze of whiskey, each port was much the same as the one he’d
        just left -barrooms and trouble. Eventually the alcohol abuse took its toll and, no longer fit to work, he returned to the
        familiar mountains of North Carolina. He worked when and where he could, but only long enough to buy another jug of
        the clear liquid that controlled his life.<br/><br/>
        A travelling circus hired him as a maintenance mechanic and thus began a drunken tour of small-town America.<br/><br/>
        Weeks, months and years passed in a blur and increasingly he awoke in jail cells with cuts and bruises that he couldn’t
        explain. Eventually fired from the circus, he found himself in an unfamiliar small town in Pennsy lvania. Odd jobs kept
        him in liquor for a time but as his health deteriorated, he became incapable of even the simplest labor.<br/><br/>
        In the last, deadly stages of alcoholism he collected welfare and had whiskey delivered to his shabby rented room.<br/><br/>
        One evening Jack was found unconscious in an alcohol-induced coma, and rushed to the emergency room.<br/><br/>
        While in the hospital, doctors convinced him to seek treatment. Having nowhere else to turn he accepted. That
        became the turning point in his life. By the time I met Jack, it had been several years since he had “taken any liquor.”<br/><br/>
        I had screwed up a good career in New Y ork City. In the process, I’d alienated everyone I knew. Overwhelmed by
        self-pity and depression, for several years I hid in the bottom of a gin bottle, afraid to live but even more terrified to
        die. For reasons I still don’t understand, Providence stepped in and, after receiving much needed help, I started the
        difficult task of putting my life back together. I moved to a small town to start over. And more than a year later, my
        career prospects were improving steadily. But emotionally, I was not doing well. Then I met Jack.<br/><br/>
        I had been staring at a lobby office directory for several minutes when a little round man in blue work clothes
        waddled toward me. Grinning at my confusion, he pointed me in the right direction.<br/><br/>
        I hadn’t taken more than a few steps when, in a friendly Southern drawl, he called after me, “and by the way, son, I
        can’t recall when I’ve last seen a feller look as down in the mouth as you.”<br/><br/>
        Surprised at this personal observation, I turned towards him. With an almost sad, yet sincere expression, this
        stranger looked me in the eye and said softly, “Son, if nobody’s told you they loved you today... I do.” With key s
        jingling, he turned and disappeared through a door into the stairwell.<br/><br/>
        This warm, smiling janitor touched my heart and I would find excuses to visit “his” office building. Sitting in his
        cluttered basement office we made small talk. Gradually I came to recognize the priceless experience and wisdom he
        was imparting to me. When we walked along Main Street, passing cars honked greetings and shop owners stepped out
        to say hello. I marveled at the magical effect this once hopeless man had on people. “Everyday is a blessing,” he would
        tell me. “I should have been dead a long time ago, but for some reason the good Lord seen fit to give me a second
        chance and I am to use it to help folks.”<br/><br/>
        His philosophy for living was simple: “Live a day at a time and do the best you can. Ask the good Lord to look after
        you when you wake up; and thank him before you go to sleep.” I saw him lend money to people, knowing he would
        probably not be repaid. If someone admired something he owned, more than likely, he would make them a gift of it.<br/><br/>
        My career came together and l was again working on Madison Avenue. With Jack’s support and friendship, my
        personal life turned around. I met and fell in love with a remarkable woman and, a year after we met, this beautiful
        lady agreed to become my wife.<br/><br/>
        On a breezy, summer afternoon I stood at the altar of a church wearing an ill-fitting tux and a comfortable grin.<br/><br/>
        Accompanied by organ music, the love of my life, resplendent in her lace wedding gown, slowly made her way down
        the center aisle.<br/><br/>
        The priest posed the question, “Who gives this woman away?” For a fleeting moment, the altar glowed as if
        enveloped by a mist of pastels, and the clean, fresh scent of approaching rain drifted through the church. As I took my
        bride’s hand, we looked into the misty blue eyes of the one whose love and guidance had made this day possible.<br/><br/>
        And my best friend, Jack, smiled at us and responded proudly, “I do.”

        pounds of me - trying to crawl out of an alcohol-fueled breakdown.<br/><br/>
        I got tons of visitors as soon as I arrived. Apparently, my impending crash was obvious to
        everyone but me.<br/><br/>
        I had lots of food to encourage me to eat and build up my strength. I had my diary to chronicle my journey back
        from hell. I had my ever-present cigarettes and lighter.<br/><br/>
        The only thing I didn’t have was my wedding band. The crises piled up from my out-of-control drinking, and my
        weight crashed down from my too-well-controlled lack of eating. Somehow the wedding band that my husband put on
        my finger just six months earlier had slid off. I remembered putting it on in the morning, but not taking it off that night.
        I assumed I took the ring off to wash dishes. I checked the kitchen and my clothes, tore the bedroom apart, then the
        bathroom, the kitchen again, and even the cat’s litter box. Nothing.<br/><br/>
        With my husband on a business trip, it was the loneliest night of my life as I sat next to the kitty litter box crying
        my eyes out over the loss of my wedding band. Then I went outside and sifted through two weeks of trash while the
        cold rain pelted me. It was no use.<br/><br/>
        I went back inside, dried myself off and tried to get rip-roaring drunk on applejack. I hated applejack, which is
        probably why it was the only thing left in the house to drink. I failed to even get drunk - a first! So I kept at it for five
        more days, until I ended up in the medical center where I met Ida, the cleaning lady.<br/><br/>
        “The sick ones don’t like to talk,” she told me that first morning. “Me, I enjoy talking to people. It makes the work
        more interesting.” She liked neatness in a patient. “You’re neat, and you’re not so sick you can’t talk,” she said.<br/><br/>
        As she cleaned the toilet, emptied the trash and dealt with my overflowing ashtray, she asked why I was admitted.<br/><br/>
        “I needed rest,” I said. “And I got very upset about losing my wedding band. I’m trying to calm down.”<br/><br/>
        “You need to talk to St. Anthony,” Ida said. “He finds things when you ask.”<br/><br/>
        Oh, how cute,I thought, and carefully wrote our conversation into my diary after she left, feeling very artistic for
        doing so.<br/><br/>
        The next day, Ida came back and said, “So did you find your ring?”<br/><br/>
        “No, Ida. It’s still lost.”<br/><br/>
        “Did you ask St. Anthony?”<br/><br/>
        Oh dear, was she serious about this Anthony stuff? “No,” I admitted. She looked disappointed, so I explained as
        nicely as I could. “I don’t know him, Ida. I can’t start out by asking someone I don’t know for favors.”<br/><br/>
        Ida stopped wet mopping the bathroom floor to consider the issue. “I see your point,” she said slowly. Then she
        brightened up. “Tell him I sent you. St. Anthony knows me very well. And if I’m not on shift, leave a note at the service
        room to tell me how it turns out. Just a little note, ‘Ida, St. Anthony helped.’ That’s so I can tell him thanks for you.”<br/><br/>
        Ida left, and the place got quiet, just me, my cigarettes and my diary. Do I or don’t I? I couldn’t. I just couldn’t. It
        was hokey, it was sentimental and it was hypocritical. I didn’t believe in that stuff.<br/><br/>
        But Ida did, and Ida was giving me advice on the only thing that mattered to me at that moment. I had doctors
        giving me advice on weight gain and Twelve Steppers giving advice on AA meetings. I wanted none of it. I just wanted
        my ring back.<br/><br/>
        I didn’t know how to pray and had never heard of praying to a saint, and didn’t know if Anthony was the one in the
        ads of the newspapers or not. I was desperate. But I wasn’t going to be a hypocrite. I hated hypocrites.<br/><br/>
        “I’ll write a poem,” I decided. Technically it wasn’t a prayer, so I wouldn’t be a hypocrite. It would still cover the
        bases, and it would keep me in Ida’s good graces.<br/><br/>
        NOT a Prayer to Saint Anthony
        Ida sent me to talk to you.<br/><br/>
        She knows you pretty well, she says.<br/><br/>
        It’s about my wedding ring.<br/><br/>
        Can you help me find it?<br/><br/>
        It got lost with my sanity last week.<br/><br/>
        I’m beginning to get that back.<br/><br/>
        The ring would be nice too...<br/><br/>
        The skies did not open over the medical center. The heavens did not come down, and I heard no heavenly hosts
        singing. I closed my diary and went to bed.<br/><br/>
        The next day I was released, and my husband came to collect me and start life together anew.<br/><br/>
        While I stretched out on the living room couch, he decided to jump-start the new life by removing the six weeks’
        worth of empty beer bottles taking up half of our two-car garage. Ten minutes later, he walked inside with shaking
        hands - and my wedding ring.<br/><br/>
        “It fell out of an empty six-pack container,” he said. “I was grabbing them four at a time and throwing them into
        the trunk of the car. I must have tipped one just right because the ring landed at my feet.”<br/><br/>
        Unaccustomed as I was to small miracles, prayers, saints or dumb luck, I knew it was going to be a different world
        for me from now on. I don’t know if St. Anthony was impressed with my poetry. All I knew was that Ida believed and
        lent me both her belief and her favorite saint.<br/><br/>
        I went to the phone and dialed the medical center. “Service room? I need to leave a message for Ida. It’s
        important...” I didn’t know how to pray or say thank you to God either, but I had the feeling that Ida wouldn’t mind
        pitching in to help me out again`

        pair of glasses had been missing, and my wallet had been stolen a long time ago.<br/><br/>
        Compared with my fears of the coming day, these discomforts were minor. The few
        functioning cells in my brain struggled to focus on a solution to my immediate dilemma,
        the magnitude of which I dared not contemplate. There seemed to be none; those with whom I had once been friendly
        no longer recognized me. No more rescuers! I had been abandoned.<br/><br/>
        From my vantage point under the Harrison Street on-ramp to Highway 101 South, I watched the cars speeding
        toward me, their headlights long gleaming streaks on the wet street. Stopping briefly at the traffic lights as though to
        tempt me from my lair, they then headed southward up the ramp and over my head: crmp-crmpcrmp-crmp, like a
        disembodied heartbeat as their tires contacted the tarred joints in the concrete pavement.<br/><br/>
        I had lived north of the Golden Gate Bridge for the past ten years, slowly being engulfed in the quagmire of
        alcoholism. My professional life eventually became pantomimic; I was the laughing-stock of the water-front.
        Disinclined to attend meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous because I still thought I was not one of them, I reluctantly
        took in one or two meetings when I realized that my drinking was out of control.<br/><br/>
        In March 197 8, avoiding arrest by the county sheriff for failure to appear in court, I fled to San Francisco where I
        knew I would find friends to rescue me and perhaps help me start a new life. Refusing to give me any alcohol, they
        cruelly took me to a detox on Howard Street and asked the counselor to kindly take care of me.<br/><br/>
        I left the detox after a couple of hours and wandered the alleys off Market Street searching for a drink. Befriended
        by a couple of San Francisco’s professional homeless, I eagerly swallowed some of their Thunderbird and followed
        them “home” - a collection of cardboard boxes under the freeway.<br/><br/>
        Pulling my jacket closer about me I watched the darkest, coldest hour of the morning arrive, and heard the
        rumble of traffic as the city began to awake. A motorcy cle cop shifted the focus of my nightmare. Using his baton on
        the soles of my feet, he reminded me that I had no right to any space in any part of the city.<br/><br/>
        The same counselor who had tried to persuade me to stay allowed me back into the detox. Mickey told me that
        every thing would be okay. “Stick it out,” she said, “and things will get better.”<br/><br/>
        Her words of encouragement fell on deaf ears as she found me a bed and thoughtfully removed my only valuable,
        a wrist watch.<br/><br/>
        Curled up as though in my mother’s womb, I came to on the second day after numerous fitful awakenings. The
        atmosphere reminded me of the familiar confines of the Marin County Jail - the hideous din of men trying to reconcile
        their todays with their tomorrows. Dare I ask someone what would happen to me now? What was required of me? Or
        would I simply let authority direct me where it would?<br/><br/>
        Mickey told me that I could stay five days. “Then what?” I asked, anticipating a response that would force me back
        under the Harrison Street on-ramp. Embarrassed and shamed, but forced into a rare moment of honesty, I told her
        about my homelessness and the sheriff’s arrest warrant. My counselor wrote something on a piece of paper and then
        looked up, smiling as though I had paid her a compliment. “You’re in the right place, Peter. Welcome! Let me see what
        I can do.” In a space of five heartbeats my spirits soared. I had been granted a reprieve, from what I knew not, but the
        seed of hope had been planted. A week later Mickey placed me in a twenty-eight day program in Redwood City, a
        mandatory requirement before admittance to a halfway house. Before I left the detox, she allowed me one telephone
        call to let my wife know where I was and to talk to my children.<br/><br/>
        “Hi, Dad, where are you?” A simple question, but one I didn’t know how to answer.<br/><br/>
        “I’m in the city, sweetheart. I’ve a lot of things to do. I won’t be able to see you for some time.”<br/><br/>
        “How long will that be, Dad?” I could hear her talking to her four-year-old sister.<br/><br/>
        “It’s Dad; he’s in San Francisco. No, you can’t see him - not for some time.”<br/><br/>
        I pictured them at home waiting for me, just as they had always waited for me - and had always been disappointed.<br/><br/>
        I started to cry. I could hear her quick breathing as she waited for me to saysomething.<br/><br/>
        “Okay Dad, maybe you could write or something,” she said. I thought I heard a flatness in her voice.<br/><br/>
        “Okay, Lovey,” I managed to say, choking back the sobs, “I’ll write soon.”<br/><br/>
        She hung up leaving me fraught with anxiety and worthless with shame.<br/><br/>
        John and Kitty McD. managed the twenty-eight day program. I liked them immediately, and put my entire trust in
        them. “Apart from not appearing in court, what else are you hiding from us, Peter?” John’s question caught me off
        guard and rekindled my fear of the law. I thought that if I kept quiet about it, the sheriff would eventually drop the
        charges.<br/><br/>
        “Nothing,” I said in a humbled voice. “Do I have to do something about it?”<br/><br/>
        John looked pityingly at me just as the captain of my first ship had done when I stepped on board.<br/><br/>
        “Y ep!” he said with finality. “You can’t start a sober life with a record. I’ll make arrangements with the court, and
        we’ll go and take care of it.”<br/><br/>
        The following week, I stood in the courtroom with a defender and twenty or so prisoners in orange jumpsuits. I
        became aware of a feeling of composure - of doing something right at last, and I knew that I was in good hands.<br/><br/>
        “Three years’ probation, confinement to a halfway house for two years, and weekly attendances at meetings of
        Alcoholics Anonymous.”<br/><br/>
        With those words I began a fractious honeymoon with my newfound, sober life.<br/><br/>
        As I settled into my new life at the halfway house, my days became more peaceful, my chronic anxiety less
        intrusive. The children fitted into a part of my soul I had made especially for them. Not perfect, but still part of me. I
        still yearned to be free again, but patience had become one of the rewards of sobriety. The urge to drink no longer
        plagued me. The seed had been deeply sown and it was now up to me to keep it nourished. Could I do it or would I fail
        again like I had so many times before?<br/><br/>
        It is twenty-six years ago almost to the day that I tottered into that San Francisco detox helpless and hopeless -
        but all at once, no longer homeless. It was there that I came to know the real meaning of true love - one drunk looking
        after another drunk. It was there that I learned that if I took certain simple steps, my life would improve in ways that I
        could not then envisage. I visit my family in England regularly and a loving understanding is our bond, laughter is our
        antidote to past sadness. My two American daughters live close by and we are once again a family.<br/><br/>
        These promises have become my reality.<br/><br/>
        I take note of a curious characteristic about the manner in which sobriety makes itself manifest in my spirit. It is
        as though I have been given the chance to relive part of my life again. Only in retrospect does each year become
        gentler than the year before and the change is as inconspicuous as the beating of my heart.

        contentEn: `Loud, pulsating music filled the high school gym for our last senior dance just days before
        graduation. The smell of perfume and hairspray mixed with sweat and cologne as my
        girlfriends and I waited with nervous anticipation for the cute boys from the soccer team to
        ask us to dance.<br/><br/>
        We had practiced the latest dance steps for so many hours that we paired off onto the dance
        floor like one body. As my partner spun me around I laughed, feeling silly and losing myself in the
        moment. It felt wonderful but uncomfortable at the same time.<br/><br/>
        Suddenly, above the noise of the band, my best friend’s voice brought me back to reality. “Your father’s here!” she
        said urgently, pointing to a large figure in the doorway silhouetted by the bright lights of the corridor. The head turned
        back and forth, searching.<br/><br/>
        I quickly ducked down into the crowd and made my way to a dark corner behind the stage next to the powerful
        speakers. My heart was pounding from anxiety and fear, not from the beat of the drummer. If he comes in everyone
        will see him - they’ll know.<br/><br/>
        I frantically rubbed my lipstick off with the back of my hand and rushed toward the doorway where the imposing
        figure scanning the crowd still stood. As I made my way through flailing arms and stomping feet I said good-bye, not
        stopping to answer the questions such as: “Why is he here so early?” “Do you have to leave now?” “Where are you
        going? The dance isn’t over ’til eleven.”<br/><br/>
        “Hi, Daddy! I’m ready to go,” I said, trying to sound nonchalant and happy to see him. I gently guided him away
        from the doorway and down the corridor to avoid the inevitable humiliation I would have felt if he had set foot on the
        dance floor or spoken to someone. The smell of his breath, his slurred words and the confusion in his eyes would be a
        dead giveaway - they’d know.<br/><br/>
        In September I spent the ride to college remembering the friendships that had grown over the last four years. I
        always tried to focus on the good and forget the bad. I recalled the time spent at friends’ homes, watching mothers and
        fathers, sisters and brothers laughing and eating together as a family. They could never understand how lucky they
        were to have their father sitting at the dinner table passing the potatoes, not beers to his buddies at the bar. When their
        dads went to the store at eleven o’clock in the morning, they didn’t stagger in hours later carrying sour milk.<br/><br/>
        Moving into the dorm went smoothly - no arguments, no accidents. My mother, father and sister set up my room
        to be comfortable, my new home. After an exhausting day of emptying suitcases and boxes, my family left and I lay on
        the dumpy dorm mattress and looked around the room. Roommate asleep, nice view of the moon from our window -
        just like my room at home. It even had that special touch - loud snoring accompanied by the smell of stale beer and
        cigarettes.<br/><br/>
        This was my fresh start, a new life.<br/><br/>
        My classes went well until I found myself sitting in a lecture hall hearing about the latest clinical techniques for
        dealing with alcoholics. I already knew how to deal with them and didn’t want to spend another day, let alone the rest
        of a lifetime, dealing with those people.<br/><br/>
        There’s always an excuse, always a fight, always a scene. Pouring their booze down the sink doesn’t help. Forget
        that family vacation at the beach because promises are made to be broken. And there’s no point in saying a word as
        your mother wakes you up in the middle of the night. You don’t complain while standing on the dark street corner in
        your pajamas and winter coat watching and waiting for your uncle’s blue Chevy to come into sight. But you pray with
        all your heart that no one you know will drive by and see you. You’re on the run again, hiding your secret like you hide
        your face from the headlights of the approaching Chevy.<br/><br/>
        The other college freshmen talked about their reasons for enrolling in the class. They wanted to understand the
        causes, the prevention, the treatment plans for alcoholic clients. They strived to be professionals in the substance
        abuse field. They wanted to learn more about AA.<br/><br/>
        Daddy, maybe you should go.<br/><br/>
        “Hey, I’d go to AA if I was an alcoholic, but you see, I’m not an alcoholic.”<br/><br/>
        Okay, Daddy - whatever you say.<br/><br/>
        As the discussion continued, someone mentions “AlAnon” and it caught my attention. That was a new one on me,
        a program for spouses and families of alcoholics. No harm in checking it out. No one will have to know what I left
        behind.<br/><br/>
        Not one face at the meeting looked familiar, but they all looked hopeful. As I looked for a seat way in the back I
        began having second thoughts. Maybe this wasn’t such a good idea; I can leave now with my secret still intact.<br/><br/>
        Someone touched my arm. “Please join us.”<br/><br/>
        As this woman swept her arm across the room, the faces blended into one another, looked at me and smiled. I
        didn’t know what to do. I didn’t know if I belonged there. I felt their eyes searching my face, looking for clues as to
        what was in my head, trying to read my mind, uncover my secrets, my memory, the essence of who I am.<br/><br/>
        In a single moment, one of true clarity, as I tried desperately to come up with an excuse for leaving, the woman
        simply said, “It’s okay - we know.”`

        stay for a while and leave footprints on our heart and

        author: `Robert J. Ackerman, Ph.D`,
        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `One of the biggest challenges against the war on alcohol and drug abuse is always fought
        on the field of prevention. Do all of the efforts to reduce addiction and the pain for many
        families really help? Year after year we continue with prevention efforts, but there is
        always more to do.<br/><br/>
        Sometimes you don’t know if your efforts make a difference. Sometimes you wonder if anyone
        is listening. However, once in a while you get a sign that someone was listening and that your
        efforts are appreciated.<br/><br/>
        Many years ago as a director of an alcohol and drug abuse treatment program for the U.S. Army, I remembered all
        of our efforts at prevention as well as treatment. As part of our prevention efforts we spoke to many groups of people
        and especially to students in the local schools. Teachers would call us and ask if we had anyone who could come to the
        school and present information about alcohol and drug abuse as well as interact with the students. Rather than sending
        just one person to present I would usually send a team of three or four people to not only talk about alcohol and drug
        information, but also to share their stories when appropriate.<br/><br/>
        One particular request came from a local junior high school. For some reason I decided to go with the team that
        morning and to help with the presentation. We had a group of students who were seventh- and eighth-graders for
        about an hour and a half. When the presentations were over, I asked the teachers to help us to evaluate what the
        students got from the time we shared together. However, my request was a little different from the typical feedback. I
        wanted the teachers to wait for two weeks and then ask the students who attended to write on one side of a piece of
        paper what they liked about that morning’s presentation and on the other side of the paper what they didn’t like.
        For a while I forgot about the students’ evaluations. I was getting out of the military at the time and I was busy
        with out-processing, preparing the program for a new director and getting ready to move. Like many others at the
        time, I was also soul searching over the Vietnam War.<br/><br/>
        The day before I was discharged a package arrived from the junior high school. The students sent me their
        evaluations complete with a designed cover and a letter. All of their comments were on sheets of white paper except
        one. Their comments were overwhelmingly positive as they expressed their appreciation for answering their
        questions and how honest the presenters were about their lives. Most of the papers had very similar themes. However,
        in the middle of all of these white papers there was one blue sheet of paper. It attracted my attention not only for the
        color, but also because of what the student wrote and how the student wrote it. Some of it was written in print, some of
        it in script, and the further down the page you read the larger the size of the writing as if the author was trying to find a
        way to show his enthusiasm beyond using mere words.<br/><br/>
        <img src="assets/letter.png" /><br/><br/>
        
        This paper was sent to me in 197 6. The original paper is in my office today. I do not know who sent me this paper.
        I do not know where this seventh- or eighth-grader is today, but I do know that I was in the right place at the right
        time. I know that I made the difference in the lives of two people that morning and that the healing moment was
        created for both of them. I know that the healing process began that morning for that student and that the healing
        process also began for me.<br/><br/>
        For those of you who often wonder if your efforts make a difference, I hope that you too get an old blue sheet of
        paper

        author: `Loretta McCann Bjorvik`,
        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `It had been almost six months since our daughter Kendall died, at the age of nine, after a fivemonth battle with a brain stem tumor.
        It was a devastating loss, but with two other children to love and nurture there wasn’t
        always the time to slip away and let the tears flow. Still, not being made of stone, it wasn’t easy
        to hide when the grief rushed in and made its presence known.<br/><br/>
        It was around this time that I became aware that my youngest child, Celeste, was modeling herself after a jester to
        urge my husband, Paul, and me out of our intermittent times of sadness.<br/><br/>
        It was not her job to keep us smiling, and I didn’t want her to take on the role of “caregiver and keeper of her
        parents’ hearts.” She knew, however, that there was a particular smile that she could flash at us, that pushed our
        emotions to the side and caused us to explode in an unbridled laugh.<br/><br/>
        Now, this was a welcome change at most times, but there also needs to be a time of tears to cleanse.<br/><br/>
        Rest assured, Paul and I were doing our best to keep up a good front when the family was together. Yet moments
        of sadness might overtake us. These times were relatively sporadic, but to a six-year-old child it must be painful to see
        your parents grieving.<br/><br/>
        Celeste came over to me as I sat pondering a memory. Sadness of loss must’ve been obvious across my face.<br/><br/>
        “Mommy?” She said. As I looked up to answer her, she flashed that cheesy grin that usually precedes a spontaneous
        “crack-up.”<br/><br/>
        Because I wanted her to know that it wasn’t her job to keep us smiling, I asked her to sit on my lap.<br/><br/>
        I wanted to protect her heart so I guarded my words carefully. “Celeste, Mommy likes it when you make her
        laugh, and you have a special way of doing that, too.” Celeste smiled with approval.<br/><br/>
        “You know that we all miss Kendall,” I continued, “and sometimes when we think of her... we will be happy, and
        sometimes when we think of her... it will make us sad that she isn’t here with us.”<br/><br/>
        I paused to read her expression. “Sometimes when we’re sad we might cry.”<br/><br/>
        Celeste was gazing at me steadily and mirroring my facial gestures in an effort to empathize.<br/><br/>
        “The thing is, Celeste, that I know it makes you feel sad to see Mommy or Daddy sad, and you want to make us
        smile, but there is a reason for the tears.” She was nodding her head to show her dislike for our tears.<br/><br/>
        “You know when you fall down you will scrape your knee?”<br/><br/>
        “Yes...” Celeste’s eyes were large and intense.<br/><br/>
        “What do we have to do before we put the Band-Aid on?”<br/><br/>
        “Wash it.” She was confident in her answer.<br/><br/>
        “That’s right. When Mommy and Daddy cry, it is like God washing our hearts so that he can put his bandage on us
        and help us to heal.”<br/><br/>
        Was this really me talking? I felt as if I was receiving an example from God.<br/><br/>
        Celeste was thinking this over.<br/><br/>
        “So even though you may not like to see us crying,” Celeste was shaking her head from side to side as I spoke,
        “sometimes we need to. Because the tears are actually helping us to heal.” I held her face in my hands.<br/><br/>
        “And even though I love to see your beautiful smile, please don’t be upset when you see us having a short moment
        of tears. Just know that God is helping us to wash our hearts, so that he can heal them.”<br/><br/>
        We concluded our talk with a tight hug and tickle and Celeste bounded down the stairs to resume her play.<br/><br/>
        “Thank you, God,” I prayed, “for not only helping me to explain to Celeste, but for explaining it to me.”

        contentEn: `I experienced an overwhelming passion to become an American Sign Language interpreter long
        before laws were passed to assure communication access to deaf people. In other words, I
        volunteered my interpreting services often. Sometimes, I’d work for a hug or a home-cooked
        dinner.<br/><br/>
        It took me nearly ten years to develop fluency and skills as an interpreter. The work was mentally and phy sically
        challenging. It was also incredibly rewarding when the thoughts and feelings of a hearing person went through my
        hands and actually registered under standing in the eyes of a deaf consumer. It was equally exciting to be the channel
        through which hearing people discovered the intelligence, talents, humor and value of individuals within the deaf
        community. It was truly fulfilling work.<br/><br/>
        Then it happened.<br/><br/>
        It started out like any normal Saturday morning. We were driving to a downtown restaurant to treat ourselves to
        brunch. My husband, Loui, was driving and I was window-shopping from the back seat. “Mountain of Love” was
        playing loudly on the radio and I was dancing in my seat as I celebrated the meaning of this song as it applied to our
        wonderful relationship.<br/><br/>
        Then BAM! I felt a force that thrust my head away from my body. I thought in that second, something really
        terrible is happening to us. I wasn’t sure what. I fought the force to reclaim my head and turn to see Loui, perhaps for
        the last time. He did the same. As our car continued to spin in what seemed like slow motion, we locked eyes and
        without a word said it all - including good-bye.<br/><br/>
        When the car finally came to a stop, a crowd of people peered into our car window. We ignored them and
        embraced each other in a hug that I was determined to last forever. When we finally got out of the car, I realized what
        had happened. A young man had been on his cell phone and had forgotten he was driving. He sped through a red light
        and smashed right into our lives.<br/><br/>
        I felt pain in my neck and back immediately, but felt sure I was fine. When I was not able to fill out the police
        report, I just assumed it was a result of the shock from the accident. However, as time went on, I realized I had
        difficulty remembering things. I was scheduled to interpret a very simple assignment at a television station and found
        I could not get the ideas from my head to my hands. I could not find the signs.<br/><br/>
        The doctor said my brain had been bruised in the accident. This could be temporary, but may be permanent. Only
        time would tell. I stopped interpreting and waited for time to give me the answer.<br/><br/>
        I was a person who was defined by what I did. My work was my reason for being. I was faced with the question - If
        you take away what I do... who am I? It was a long and trying time searching for the answer, looking for a sign.<br/><br/>
        Everyday, I would secretly attempt to interpret to see if the spell was broken. I’d listen to the radio, or watch a
        few minutes of television and try to find my hard-earned skills - the meaning of my existence. Each time, I was unable
        to retrieve the ideas from my brain, to express through the signs that now seemed forever lost to me.<br/><br/>
        I was also struggling with simple life tasks. I would begin to express an idea only to come to mid-sentence and lose
        the end of the thought. I would enter a room and not remember why I was there.<br/><br/>
        While it was one of the most difficult times in my life, it was the impetus for me to discover I am much more than
        what I do. I began attending a church for spiritual support. I went to a church that provided an interpreter. There were
        several deaf friends who attended so I enjoyed the social contact as well as the spiritual inspiration.<br/><br/>
        One Sunday, there were about eight deaf people in attendance. The church service began with an upbeat song.
        However, the chair where the interpreter usually sat on stage was empty. My legs kept urging me to run up there and
        fill the space. My heart argued with my “bruised brain.” Would I be able to do it? As I saw the deaf people’s
        disappointment, I knew I had to try. I walked up the stairs to the stage following the rhy thm, not of the music, but of
        my rapidly beating of my heart.<br/><br/>
        On stage, the music flooded into my ears. The words came at me like a challenge. I looked out into the large
        congregation and drew a terrifying and now familiar blank. I was beginning to panic. But as I looked into the receptive
        eyes of the deaf congregants, I raised my arms and, to my amazement, my hands took flight. It was as if they had a life,
        or perhaps a voice of their own.<br/><br/>
        As the sermon began, the words and their beautiful meaning came to and through me. Articulately expressed with
        the voice in my hands, it all landed lovingly in the hearts and minds of my deaf friends through expectant eyes. In the
        service of others, I had found and reclaimed myself.<br/><br/>
        After church, a large burly man approached me. “I’m not overly religious,” he said shy ly, “but I need to tell you...<br/><br/>
        I saw something around you when you were signing. Others saw it too. We don’t know what it was, but it was something
        to behold.”<br/><br/>
        I don’t know if a miracle happened that day. I only know that it is through reaching out in service to others that we
        most often discover the path to our own healing.

        contentEn: `single note rises, then falls like a raindrop at my feet, shattering into a thousand tiny
        rainbows. I think there must be an angel caged in the cell next to mine. If I could play
        the instrument of my voice as miraculously, would I be closer to God? It seems my
        destiny is to be an ordinary raven, even here, where birds are forbidden to fly.<br/><br/>
        The jangling of keys and slamming of gates break my reverie. A prison guard bellows, “Get out here, crack head!”
        I rise, as do the over forty other women who have shared this cell with me over the past three days. None of us is
        certain to whom she refers. It is not me, not this time.<br/><br/>
        I sink back to the floor that has become so cold I could ice skate on it. I seek out the largest woman (the fat ones
        give off the most body heat), and huddle close to her. In here we have no prejudice or pride. Out there we took each
        other’s money and drugs, in here we give each other warmth and comfort.<br/><br/>
        A harsh voice shouts, “Barr!” It is my turn. I enter the shower room and strip quickly. I immediately squat and
        cough. I want to please the guards. I have been here before and I know the rules well. I am shoved into an icy shower
        and sprayed with horrid smelling lotion to “de-louse” me. I wonder why they bother when they don’t wash our clothes.<br/><br/>
        I am pushed soaking wet into another freezing cell. I dry off as best as I can with my filthy pants.<br/><br/>
        Just as sleep comes to steal me from this misery, another voice intrudes, this one much kinder than I am used to.<br/><br/>
        “Ladies, my name is Mr. Smith. A few years ago I was in a worse position than you, and look at me now. I have a
        fine job, fine clothes and I’m fine lookin’ too. If you want what I’ve got, you’ve got to do what I did to get it. I pledge my
        support to anyone willing to make a change.”<br/><br/>
        I step out of my cell not even flinching when the gate clangs shut behind me. As we are walking to the dormitory
        where I will be housed I hear shouting and stomping. I am amazed when we arrive and I see that it is military
        marching.<br/><br/>
        “My God, Mr. Smith,” I exclaim, “you didn’t tell me I was joining the army!”<br/><br/>
        “There’s a lot more to it than this, Mary,” he says.<br/><br/>
        A woman detaches herself from a marching group and comes towards me. “Hi, I’m Lori, the unit captain. In this
        program it’s mandatory that we attend school. We have five minutes to line up so let’s go.”<br/><br/>
        We march down the bleak hallways to school shouting an army cadence. I suppress an urge to giggle, especially
        since other women are watching us with interest. Unlike the adolescent population housed in jail, adults do not get to
        go to school. Most of the women in general population spend their days bored and frustrated, sometimes fighting, and
        getting high. Yes, there are drugs in jail.<br/><br/>
        After two hours we march back to our dorm where a social worker greets us. She is the only social worker for over
        two thousand women so we are fortunate to have her tonight. She suggests that we go into residential treatment when
        we leave, but I can’t see myself doing that after being locked up for a year. We meet with her in a group to discuss our
        issues, which run the gamut from being abused, to being illiterate. This is one time when I am glad there are only one
        hundred beds available for treatment; so I may get a chance to ask her a question.<br/><br/>
        A lady I don’t know starts the group. “I’m lucky they let me back in here,” she says through tears. “They told me
        not to go home, but I missed my kids so much. When I got there they just wanted to go out with friends, and my
        daughter hid her purse from me when she thought I wasn’t looking. I didn’t want her to see me crying so I went to a
        friend’s house. Just like when I got busted, she was gettin’ high. I was upset so I got high right along with her. This time
        I am going to take the cotton out of my ears and stick it in my mouth.”<br/><br/>
        God works in my sterious way s. Though our stories are not the same I feel the same way. I have not seen my
        children or their father for two years. I do not want to make the same mistakes as this woman. I was no longer afraid to
        die, I was afraid of living my life the way I was. I decided to go to residential treatment when I was released and tried to
        convince my peers to do the same.<br/><br/>
        The day of my release has come and I am sent off with hugs. I await the volunteer who will drive me from jail to
        the program and I laugh aloud when I see that it is Mr. Smith. There is a certain symmetry to arriving at yet another
        program with Mr. Smith, and I pray I will be as successful in this one.<br/><br/>
        A single note rises then falls like a raindrop at my feet, shattering into a thousand tiny rainbows. I step up to the
        cell and say, “Honey, you sing like an angel. A few years ago I was in a worse position than you, and look at me now.
        Would you like to hear more?” The angel looks at me and smiles.

        happen to be going down`,
        author: `Christine Learmonth`,
        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `Choices people make and circumstances in their life sometimes conspire to teach lessons in
        the most difficult way s. Finding myself in prison was both the worst and the best thing that
        ever happened to me. Following the path of my addiction put me there, and a courtordered drug program set me free.<br/><br/>
        For two hours everyday over a period of nine months we would meet. Weekly we broke up into small groups of
        six to ten women and went through a process of intense intervention facilitated by one of the five counselors.<br/><br/>
        Each of us received individual treatment plans based on our entry interview. We wrote papers, read books,
        watched videos, did our homework and passed our tests, but what counted the most toward completing the program
        was class participation.<br/><br/>
        The significance and depth of each woman’s story differed vastly. We came from all walks of life, spanned every
        racial, religious and age boundary. The one thing we all had in common was we were addicts. Whether it was alcohol or
        drugs addiction, addiction had become an overwhelming, destructive force in our lives.<br/><br/>
        I had always thought my life experiences were unique but after listening to the other women’s stories, I knew I
        wasn’t alone. Realizing that was powerful for me. We shared things about ourselves that no one, no matter how close
        they were to us, would ever have known. Some of our experiences had never been said aloud.<br/><br/>
        My primary was a black woman who carried herself proudly, head high and poised. When Carla Davis spoke, her
        words were strong and direct. She moved around the classroom with the gracefulness of a rose swaying to a summer
        breeze. I was grateful in so many ways that she was my primary. I admired her; I wanted to emulate her and devote
        myself to helping people. Unfortunately I was sitting on the wrong side of the desk.<br/><br/>
        I was nothing but a number to the prison sy stem, but Ms. Davis always treated me with respect and spoke with
        words that allowed me to maintain my dignity. Her advice was given with the wisdom of a thousand scholars and she
        could identify and sympathize with my internal turmoil over my biracial son. Her kind, caring eyes never left my face
        when I would go on and on about my problems. Sometimes I’d look up and see tears brimming over her bottom lids,
        ready to slide down over her high cheekbones the next time she blinked. Tissues were always a part of her desktop
        decor.
        Nine months later it was graduation day. A person from each small group was selected for having improved the
        most. I glanced around the room, silently tallying who had opened up the most, had shared their deepest darkest
        feelings and worked the hardest.<br/><br/>
        Before I completed my mental score sheet everyone was clapping and looking at me. My name had been called. I
        stood up and moved slowly to the front of the room in disbelief. When I raised my head and looked into Carla’s eyes
        tears were once again brimming over her bottom lids. She stretched out her arms and wrapped them around me. Her
        hug was as loving as if she were my own mother. She whispered in my ear, “I am so proud of you, you’ve earned this.”<br/><br/>
        When the day finally came to walk out of prison I was convinced once I was on the other side of that fence I would
        never look back. I would put that part of my life completely out of my mind. It hasn’t quite worked out that way. In my
        day -to-day living I still hear Carla giving me advice, and when I become a little shaky in my recovery I just think of
        that day and the warmth of that hug and it gets me through “one day at a time.”

        contentEn: `The first time I walked into “the rooms” over seventeen years ago, I saw a group of older
        people sitting around laughing and drinking coffee. As I shy ly looked around the room, I
        spied the coffee and cookies sitting on the table. A lady with a friendly enough face
        walked over to me and asked me if I would like to have a seat. I told her, yes, but asked
        her if I could buy a cup of coffee first. She told me that the coffee is always free and that it
        would always be brewing, five days a week, especially holidays.<br/><br/>
        Five years later, after interrupted attempts at staying clean and sober, despite the fact that I
        was singing in the choir and working, I remembered that ten o’clock meeting.<br/><br/>
        When I walked in the room, the same group of people seemed to be sitting in the exact same seats. A friendly
        woman walked up to me and said, “Good seeing you! We’ve missed you! Would you like to have a seat?” Just as if she
        had not noticed the “slight” weight loss I had undergone. This time, I took a seat, and then rushed to the coffee pot!
        A little over seven years ago, with sunken cheeks, no teeth, and a few more scars on my face, I thought about that
        little meeting, and thought I would drop in on them again. The same people were sitting in the same seats! I walked
        over to the most approachable-looking older gentleman there and said, “How can I get a seat here? You have been
        sitting in the same seat for years.”<br/><br/>
        The young lady sitting next to him said to me, “Honey, take this seat. It is now yours. I have been sitting in this
        seat now for almost ten years between these two gentlemen, and I have not used. They tell me that this is a good
        recovery seat.” She then got out of her seat and offered it to me. Mr. Avery (the elderly gentleman) whispered in my
        ear, “Now there’s another thing about maintaining your seat; you have to be the first ass in it each day!”
        So, for the next two years, everyday, Monday through Friday and especially holidays, I was the first person in my
        seat! I discovered the joys of “the meeting before the meeting” and learned the pleasure of “the meeting after the
        meeting!”<br/><br/>
        Soon, as the responsibilities on my job increased, I was not able to make the meeting everyday, but would come
        whenever I had a day off or could take an early lunch and especially holidays. Whenever I came, I came early enough
        to make sure that my seat was indeed, my seat!<br/><br/>
        A few weeks after my seventh year of uninterrupted recovery, a young lady walked into “the rooms” and came
        straight to me at the meeting and said, “I’ve been noticing you for a few years sitting in the same seat. How do I get a
        seat?” I looked in her eyes and said to her, “My sister! Welcome! You can have mine. This is a good recovery seat. The
        lady who sat in it before me gave it to me. It is yours now!” I smiled as I watched Mr. Avery lean over and whisper
        something in her ear. I knew what he was telling her!<br/><br/>
        The precious gift of recovery that they had given me had blossomed into the realization that wherever I sit within
        “the rooms,” is a “good” recovery seat.<br/><br/>
        As long as I bring my ass and put it there!`

        title: ``,
        author: `Jack Canfield`,
        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `I have a friend named Monty Roberts who owns a horse ranch in San Y sidro. He has let me use
        his house to put on fund-raising events to raise money for youth at-risk programs.<br/><br/>
        The last time I was there he introduced me by saying, “I want to tell you why I let Jack use
        my house. It all goes back to a story about a young man who was the son of an itinerant horse
        trainer who would go from stable to stable, race track to race track, farm to farm and ranch to
        ranch, training horses. As a result, the boy’s high school career was continually interrupted. When he was a senior he
        was asked to write a paper about what he wanted to be and do when he grew up.<br/><br/>
        “That night he wrote a seven-page paper describing his goal of someday owning a horse ranch. He wrote about his
        dream in great detail and he even drew a diagram of a 200-acre ranch, showing the location of all the buildings, the
        stables and the track. Then he drew a detailed floor plan for a 4,000 square-foot house that would sit on the 200-acre
        dream ranch.<br/><br/>
        “He put a great deal of his heart into the project and the next day he handed it in to his teacher. Two days later he
        received his paper back. On the front page was a large red F with a note that read, ‘See me after class.’<br/><br/>
        “The boy with the dream went to see the teacher after class and asked, ‘Why did I receive an F?’<br/><br/>
        “The teacher said, ‘This is an unrealistic dream for a young boy like you. You have no money. You come from an
        itinerant family. You have no resources. Owning a horse ranch requires a lot of money. You have to buy the land. You
        have to pay for the original breeding stock and later you’ll have to pay large stud fees. There’s no way you could ever
        do it.’ Then the teacher added, ‘If you will rewrite this paper with a more realistic goal, I will reconsider your grade.’<br/><br/>
        “The boy went home and thought about it long and hard. He asked his father what he should do. His father said,<br/><br/>
        ‘Look, son, you have to make up your own mind on this. However, I think it is a very important decision for you.’<br/><br/>
        “Finally, after sitting with it for a week, the boy turned in the same paper making no changes at all. He stated, ‘You
        can keep the F and I’ll keep my dream.”’<br/><br/>
        Monty then turned to the assembled group and said, “I tell you this story because you are sitting in my 4,000-
        square-foot house in the middle of my 200-acre horse ranch. I still have that school paper framed over the fireplace.”<br/><br/>
        He added, “The best part of the story is that two summers ago that same schoolteacher brought 30 kids to camp out on
        my ranch for a week. When the teacher was leaving, he said, ‘Look, Monty, I can tell you this now. When I was your
        teacher, I was something of a dreamstealer. During those years I stole a lot of kids’ dreams. Fortunately you had
        enough gumption not to give up on yours.’”<br/><br/>
        Don’t let anyone steal your dreams. Follow your heart, no matter what.`

        I stared him down, eye to eye, both of us sitting cross-legged on the sidewalk in front of my
        house. The cement felt warm. Crab grass poked through and scratched my thigh.
        I won the stare-down.<br/><br/>
        Ray looked down at the Big Chief tablet on my lap.<br/><br/>
        “And you sure can’t win that contest, Dandi,” he mumbled. “I don’t know why you’re even entering.”<br/><br/>
        He pushed a shock of brown hair; straight as harvest wheat, out of his eyes. Ray’s mom cut both of our hair. I
        shoved mine out of my face. Then I pulled out the coupon I’d torn from the Kansas City Star sports page.<br/><br/>
        “I’m entering,” I said, “and I’m winning.”<br/><br/>
        Ray jerked the coupon out of my hand and pointed his finger at the print.<br/><br/>
        “See!” he said triumphantly. “It says right here: 1959 batboy contest. Write in seventy-five words or less why you
        want to be batboy for the KC Athletics pro baseball team. Not batgirl.” He cackled as if a batgirl was the funniest thing
        he’d ever heard.<br/><br/>
        “Well, it’s not fair!” I said, half to Ray, half to myself
        I was tired of not getting to do stuff just because I was a girl. Ray played Little League. I could knock him down
        with a line drive, hitting from my Stan Musiel batting stance. But our small Missouri town didn’t have a girls’ baseball
        team.<br/><br/>
        I was ten, the age when boys stopped caring that you could play baseball. They simply wouldn’t let you play
        because you were a girl.<br/><br/>
        My sister, Maureen, slammed the door.<br/><br/>
        “What’s going on out here?” she asked.<br/><br/>
        Maureen, who was my older sister, couldn’t tell a baseball from a football if it hit her in the face.<br/><br/>
        “Nothing,” I answered. I tucked the coupon in my tablet.<br/><br/>
        “We’re... umm... drawing,” I lied.<br/><br/>
        Ray looked confused. “Drawing? I thought we were...”<br/><br/>
        I nudged him into silence.<br/><br/>
        Maureen tried giving me one of our mother’s suspicious looks. That gesture made her look more like Bruno, our
        hound dog, when he had to go outside.<br/><br/>
        Ray and I sat in the sun and set our pencils scratching. At the end of an hour, I had fourteen paper wads to show.
        “I’m done,” Ray announced.<br/><br/>
        “Read it,” I demanded.<br/><br/>
        I crossed my fingers and hoped it would be awful.<br/><br/>
        Ray swatted at a horsefly, then held up his paper and read aloud. “I want to be a batboy for the Kansas City A’s
        because I really, really, really like baseball and I really, really, really like Kansas City and the Athletics.”<br/><br/>
        He looked wide-eyed at me. “What do you think, Dandi?”<br/><br/>
        I hadn’t hoped it would be that awful.<br/><br/>
        “Why so many reallys?” I asked.<br/><br/>
        He looked wounded. “I need the words! What do you know, anyway? You can’t even enter the contest.”<br/><br/>
        Ray left me standing alone on the sidewalk. I took in the sweet scent of the cornfields across the road and thought
        about what I might write.<br/><br/>
        The words began to flow as I put pen to paper:<br/><br/>
        My whole life people have told me that I can’t. My sister has said that I can’t sing. My teacher has said that I
        can’t spell. Mom has said that I can’t be a professional baseball player. My best friend has said that I can’t win this
        contest. I’m entering this contest to prove them wrong. I want to be your next Kansas City A’s batboy.<br/><br/>
        I signed it “Dan Daley.” My dad always called me “Dan,” short for Dandi. I addressed the envelope and mailed my
        entry.<br/><br/>
        As the months passed, then late one autumn afternoon, there was a knock at our door. When I opened the door, I
        was surprised to find two men in suits, carrying briefcases. Surely they were from out of town.<br/><br/>
        “Hello, little girl,” the shorter man said. “We’d like to speak to your brother.”<br/><br/>
        “Don’t have a brother,” I said.<br/><br/>
        The taller man wrinkled his forehead and popped open his briefcase. He took out a handful of papers. Both men
        studied them while I stood in the doorway, guarding my brotherless home.<br/><br/>
        “Is this 508 Samuel Street?” asked the shorter one.<br/><br/>
        “I guess,” I answered.<br/><br/>
        Nobody used house numbers in our neighborhood. There were only two houses on our road.<br/><br/>
        “Isn’t this the home of Dan Daley?”<br/><br/>
        A light went on in my head. Then I got it.<br/><br/>
        “Mom!” I screamed, without taking my eyes off the strangers. “Come here! Hurry!” Sure enough, I had won the
        batboy contest. My words had done the trick!<br/><br/>
        I let Mom explain about my not having a brother. I confessed I’d entered as “Dan.” Maureen and Bruno started to
        congratulate me - but not the strangers.<br/><br/>
        “What’s wrong?” I asked, a familiar feeling of dread creeping up my spine.<br/><br/>
        “Well,” said the taller one, “you’re not a boy.”<br/><br/>
        “Well, duh,” I answered.<br/><br/>
        “Contest rules clearly state ‘a boy aged eight to twelve,”’ said the shorter one.<br/><br/>
        “But I won!” I protested.<br/><br/>
        “Little girl,” he said, “this was not a batgirl contest.”<br/><br/>
        The men left, taking with them my dream of being a Kansas City A’s batboy. Hoping to make up for it, they sent us
        season tickets, team jackets, autographed baseballs, hats and a hardwood bat. I never did wear that hat. I became a St.<br/><br/>
        Louis Cardinals fan instead. But I did grab that bat the day it came. I marched to our school playground where Ray,<br/><br/>
        Tommy and the guys were in the middle of a pickup game.<br/><br/>
        “I’m batting,” I said, one-arming Ray away from the plate.<br/><br/>
        The guys groaned, but Ray seemed to know something more was at stake. He nodded to the pitcher. I took the first
        pitch, high and outside, just the way I liked it. I knew I’d send that ball over the fence for a home run. I turned my back
        before the ball hit the street, finally bouncing into a ditch.<br/><br/>
        Gently, I released my Kansas City Athletics bat and heard it bounce in the dirt. I proudly walked the bases to
        home plate, leaving that bat where it had fallen.<br/><br/>
        “Let the batboy get it.”`

        The night before my interview, I spent two hours going through my closet to pick out
        just the right outfit. What would I say to him? I curled up into my pillowy bed and stared at the
        ceiling, unable to sleep. How should I act? Nervous, I shut my eyes and tried to get some rest, but

        My mother came into the room, “What’s wrong?” Her eyes bulged as she withdrew in terror.<br/><br/>
        “What’s happening to me?” I slurred to her.<br/><br/>
        “I’ll take you to the emergency room,” she finally gasped.<br/><br/>
        We were rushed in. The nurse took one look at me and called in a specialist. There, under the blazing white lights,
        my mother and I waited.<br/><br/>
        After several hours of tests, the doctor finally explained, “You have Bell’s palsy. It is a condition in which your
        face muscles tighten because of stress. You need to get plenty of sleep, and in a few days your face will return to
        normal.”<br/><br/>
        “But I have a job interview this afternoon,” I sadly said.<br/><br/>
        “I’m sorry,” the doctor said, concerned. “You should reschedule, maybe for later in the week.”<br/><br/>
        During the long car ride home, all I could think about was how bad it would look to reschedule. Certainly, that
        would dampen my chances. Nobody reschedules with the district attorney. All the other applicants would have the
        advantage then, I concluded.<br/><br/>
        I looked at my watch and made the decision, “Mom, drop me off on Jacob Street. I’m going to the interview.”<br/><br/>
        “Honey, I don’t think you should. You look... strange.” She said ever so gently.<br/><br/>
        I knew she was right. He probably would take one look at me and judge me by my appearance rather than by my
        experience and talent. I probably shouldn’t go. But if I didn’t, I’d always wonder if I could have gotten my dream job.<br/><br/>
        “No, Mom, take me there.”<br/><br/>
        Reluctantly, she took me where I wanted to go. I walked right into the formidable office with the mahogany
        furniture and pillars of white marble, not letting my own selfconsciousness or any disease stop me. Not now, not when
        I had worked so hard for so long to be given this opportunity.<br/><br/>
        I went to the woman sitting behind the front desk and said, as well as I could, “Nicole Jenkins to see Mr.
        Robertson.”<br/><br/>
        She stared at my face. “He’s expecting you. Go right in.”<br/><br/>
        I entered the room to her right and saw a gray -haired man sitting behind the large desk reading a file.
        Suddenly my nerves got the best of me, and I had to sit. I took the chair in front of him.
        “Hello,” he said. “Miss Jenkins?”<br/><br/>
        “Yes. Please excuse me. I’m having a Bell’s palsy attack. My doctor explained to me that it would last a few days. I
        came right from the hospital.”<br/><br/>
        “You’re very dedicated to come when you’re not feeling up to speed,” he responded, after a pause.<br/><br/>
        “Yes, Sir.”<br/><br/>
        He spent a few minutes looking over my application. “Is every thing on here correct?” He held it out to me.<br/><br/>
        I glanced over the paper, “Yes, but I failed to mention I type seventy-five words per minute.”<br/><br/>
        “Wonderful,” he smiled. “Out of one hundred points, you had our highest score on the application test. You scored
        well above average on grammar and computer programs.”<br/><br/>
        “It comes easily for me,” I honestly replied.<br/><br/>
        “Well, you are certainly qualified. You have an impressive background with related experience. I see here you
        worked for the navy.”<br/><br/>
        “Directly with legal affairs,” I reiterated.<br/><br/>
        “When are you available?”<br/><br/>
        “Two weeks.”<br/><br/>
        He gazed down onto his desk calendar. “The 27 th then, be here at 9:00 A.M.”<br/><br/>
        I gasped, “You’re hiring me?”<br/><br/>
        “Yes, you’re perfect for the position.”<br/><br/>
        I stood. “Thank you for believing in me. I won’t let you down.”<br/><br/>
        “I know,” he smiled, rising from his desk to shake my hand. “Not only have you got the skills I’m looking for, you
        also have the character.”

        contentEn: `A little kid down at our church in Huntington Beach came up to me after he heard me talk
        about the Children’s Bank. He shook my hand and said, “My name is Tommy Tighe, I’m six
        years old and I want to borrow money from your Children’s Bank.”<br/><br/>
        I said, “Tommy, that’s one of my goals, to loan money to kids. And so far all the kids
        have paid it back. What do you want to do?”<br/><br/>
        He said, “Ever since I was four I had a vision that I could cause peace in the world. I want to make a bumper
        sticker that says, ‘PEACE, PLEASE! DO IT FOR US KIDS,’ signed ‘Tommy ’.”<br/><br/>
        “I can get behind that,” I said. He needed \$454 to produce 1,000 bumper stickers. The Mark Victor Hansen
        Children’s Free Enterprise Fund wrote a check to the printer who was printing the bumper stickers.<br/><br/>
        Tommy’s dad whispered in my ear, “If he doesn’t pay the loan back, are you going to foreclose on his bicy cle?”
        I said, “No, every kid is born with honesty, morality and ethics. They have to be taught something else. I believe
        he’ll pay us back.” If you have a child who is over nine, let them w-o-r-k for m-o-n-e-y for someone honest, moral and
        ethical so they learn the principle early.<br/><br/>
        We gave Tommy a copy of all of my tapes and he listened to them twenty-one times each and took ownership of
        the material. It says, “Always start selling at the top.” Tommy convinced his dad to drive him up to Ronald Reagan’s
        home. Tommy rang the bell and the gatekeeper came out. Tommy gave a two-minute, irresistible sales presentation on
        his bumper sticker. The gatekeeper reached in his pocket, gave Tommy \$1.50 and said, “Here, I want one of those.<br/><br/>
        Hold on and I’ll get the former President.”<br/><br/>
        I asked, “Why did you ask him to buy?” He said, “You said in the tapes to ask everyone to buy.” I said, “I did. I did.<br/><br/>
        I’m guilty.”<br/><br/>
        He sent a bumper sticker to Mikhail Gorbachev with a bill for \$1.50 in U.S. funds. Gorbachev sent him back
        \$1.50 and a picture that said, “Go for peace, Tommy,” and signed it, “Mikhail Gorbachev, President.”<br/><br/>
        Since I collect autographs, I told Tommy, “I’ll give you \$500 for Gorbachev’s autograph.”<br/><br/>
        He said, “No thanks, Mark.”<br/><br/>
        I said, “Tommy, I own several companies. When you get older, I’d like to hire you.”<br/><br/>
        “Are you kidding?” he answered. “When I get older, I’m going to hire you.”<br/><br/>
        The Sundayedition of the Orange County Register did a feature section on Tommy’s story. Marty Shaw, the
        journalist, interviewed Tommy for six hours and wrote a phenomenal interview. Marty asked Tommy what he thought
        his impact would be on world peace. Tommy said, “I don’t think I am old enough yet; I think you have to be eight or
        nine to stop all the wars in the world.”<br/><br/>
        Marty asked, “Who are your heroes?”<br/><br/>
        He said, “My dad, George Burns, Wally Joiner and Mark Victor Hansen.” Tommy has good taste in role models.<br/><br/>
        Three days later, I got a call from the Hallmark Greeting Card Company. A Hallmark franchisee had faxed a copy of
        the Register article. They were having a convention in San Francisco and wanted Tommy to speak. After all, they saw
        that Tommy had nine goals for himself:<br/><br/>
        l. Call about cost.<br/><br/>
        2.Have bumper sticker printed.<br/>
        3. Make a plan for a loan.<br/>
        4. Find out how to tell people.<br/>
        5. Get address of leaders.<br/>
        6. Write a letter to all of the presidents and leaders of other countries and send them all a free bumper sticker.<br/>
        7. Talk to everyone about peace.<br/>
        8. Call the newspaper stand and talk about my business.<br/>
        9. Have a talk with school.<br/><br/>
        Hallmark wanted my company, Look Who’s Talking, to book Tommy to speak. While the talk did not happen
        because the two-week lead time was too short, the negotiation between Hallmark, myself and Tommy was fun and
        powerful.<br/><br/>
        Joan Rivers called Tommy Tighe to be on her television show. Someone had also faxed her a copy of the Register
        interview on Tommy.<br/><br/>
        “Tommy,” Joan said, “this is Joan Rivers and I want you on my TV show which is viewed by millions.<br/><br/>
        “Great!” said Tommy. He didn’t know any thing about her.<br/><br/>
        “I’ll pay you \$300,” said Joan.<br/><br/>
        “Great!” said Tommy. Having listened repeatedly to and mastered my Sell Yourself Rich tapes, Tommy continued
        selling Joan by saying: “I am only eight years old, so I can’t come alone. You can afford to pay for my mom, too, can’t
        you, Joan?”<br/><br/>
        “Yes!” Joan replied.<br/><br/>
        “By the way, I just watched a Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous show and it said to stay at the Trump Plaza when
        you’re in New York. You can make that happen, can’t you, Joan?”<br/><br/>
        “Yes,” she answered.<br/><br/>
        “The show also said when you get there, you ought to visit the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty.<br/><br/>
        You can get us tickets, can’t you?”<br/><br/>
        “Yes...”<br/><br/>
        “Great. Did I tell you my mom can’t drive? So we can use your limo, can’t we?”<br/><br/>
        “Sure,” said Joan.<br/><br/>
        Tommy went on The Joan Rivers Showand wowed Joan, the camera crew, the live and television audiences. He
        was so handsome, interesting, authentic and such a great selfstarter. He told such captivating and persuasive stories
        that the audience was found pulling money out of their wallets to buy a bumper sticker on the spot.<br/><br/>
        At the end of the show, Joan asked: “Tommy do you really think your bumper sticker will cause peace in the
        world?”<br/><br/>
        Tommy, enthusiastically and with a radiant smile, said, “So far I’ve had it out two years. I’m doing pretty good,

        title: `Happiness depends upon ourselves`,
        author: `Linda Staf ord`,
        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `When I was eight years old, I saw a movie about a my sterious island that had an
        erupting volcano and lush jungles filled with wild animals and cannibals. The island
        was ruled by a beautiful woman called “Tandaleah, the Fire Goddess of the Volcano.”<br/><br/>
        It was a terrible, low-budget movie, but to me it represented the perfect life. Being
        chased by molten lava, bloodthirsty animals and savages was a small price to pay for
        freedom. I desperately wanted to be the Fire Goddess. I wrote it on my list of “Things to Be When
        I Grow Up,” and asked my girlfriend if “Fire Goddess” was spelled with two Ds.<br/><br/>
        Through the years, the school did its best to mold me into a responsible, respectable citizen, and Tandaleah was
        forgotten. My parents approved of my suitable marriage, and I spent the next twenty-five years being a good wife,
        eventually the mother of four and a very respectable, responsible member of society. My life was as bland and boring
        as a bowl of oatmeal. I knew exactly what to expect in the future: The children would grow up and leave home, my
        husband and I would grow old together and we’d baby -sit the grandchildren.<br/><br/>
        The week I turned fifty my marriage came to a sudden end. My house, furniture and every thing I’d owned was
        auctioned off to pay debts I didn’t even know existed. In a week I’d lost my husband, my home and my parents, who
        refused to accept a divorce in the family. I’d lost every thing except my four teenaged children.<br/><br/>
        I had enough money to rent a cheap apartment while I looked for a job. Or I could use every penny I had to buy
        five plane tickets from Missouri to the most remote island in the world, the Big Island of Hawaii. Everyone said I was
        crazy to think I could just run off to an island and survive. They predicted I’d come crawling back in a month. Part of
        me was afraid they were right.<br/><br/>
        The next day, my four children and I landed on the Big Island of Hawaii with less than two thousand dollars,
        knowing no one in the world was going to help us. I rented an unfurnished apartment where we slept on the floor and
        lived on cereal. I worked three jobs scrubbing floors on my hands and knees, selling nuts to tourists and gathering
        coconuts. I worked eighteen hours a day and lost thirty pounds because I lived on one meal a day. I had panic attacks
        that left me curled into a knot on the bathroom floor, shaking like a shell-shocked soldier.<br/><br/>
        One night, as I walked alone on the beach, I saw the red-orange glow of the lava pouring out of the Kilauea volcano
        in the distance. I was watching the world’s most active volcano but wasting that incredible moment because I was
        haunted by the past, exhausted by the present and terrified of the future. I’d almost achieved my childhood dream -
        but hadn’t realized it because I was focused on my burdens instead of my blessings. It was time to live my imagination
        - not my history.<br/><br/>
        Tandaleah, the Fire Goddess of the Volcano, had finally arrived!<br/><br/>
        The next day I quit my jobs and invested my last pay check in art supplies and began doing what I loved. I hadn’t
        painted a picture in fifteen years because we’d barely scratched out a living on the farm in Missouri and there hadn’t
        been money for the tubes of paint and canvas and frames. I wondered if I could still paint or if I’d forgotten how. My
        hands trembled the first time I picked up a brush, but before an hour had passed I was lost in the colors spreading
        across the canvas in front of me. I painted pictures of old sailing ships, and as soon as I started believing in myself,
        other people started believing in me, too. My first painting sold for fifteen hundred dollars before I even had time to
        frame it.<br/><br/>
        The past six years have been filled with adventures: My children and I have gone swimming with dolphins,
        watched whales and hiked around the crater rim of the volcano. We wake up every morning with the ocean in front of
        us and the volcano behind us.<br/><br/>
        The dream I’d had more than forty years ago is now reality. I live on an island with a continuouslyerupting
        volcano. The only animals in the jungle are wild boars and mongooses and there aren’t any cannibals, but often in the
        evening, I can hear the drums from native dancers on the beach.<br/><br/>
        My friends have tried countless times to introduce me to their uncles, neighbors, fathers and even grandfathers,
        hoping I’d find a mate to save me from a lonely old age. They use phrases like, “A woman of your age...” and “You
        aren’t getting any younger...” to push me into blind dates.<br/><br/>
        I gently point out that “a woman of my age” has paid her dues. I enjoyed being a wife and mother and believe in
        my heart that I was a good one. I did that job for over a quarter of a century. And now at my age, I have grown into the
        woman I wish I could have been when I was in my twenties. No, I’m not getting any younger, but neither is anyone
        else, and honestly, I wouldn’t want to be young again. I’m happier than I’ve ever been. I can paint all night and sleep
        all day without feeling guilty. I can cook or not cook. I can live on cream puffs and Pepsi for a week at a time and no
        one will lecture me on the importance of a balanced diet.<br/><br/>
        It took a long time to find myself, and I had to live alone to do it. But I am not lonely. I am free for the first time in
        my life. I am Tandaleah, the Fire Goddess of the Volcano, spelled with two Ds... And I’m living happily ever after.

        contentEn: `When I was eighteen years old, I came to America from Tel Aviv to break into the
        movies. It was a secret I kept from my parents, whom I had sold on the idea that I was
        leaving home to study journalism.<br/><br/>
        Forty-five years later, I finally lived my fantasy - a gift from my eldest son.<br/><br/>
        He is Peter David, New Y ork Times bestselling author of science-fiction novels, (Star Trek: The Next Generation,
        Deep Space Nine, The Hulk), comic books, television scripts (Babylon 5, Space Cases) and movies.<br/><br/>
        His script, Backlash: Oblivion II, was being filmed in Romania. Peter wrote a cameo for me. I would have words to
        speak and even a close-up.<br/><br/>
        I gave up my dreams of Hollywood while in my early twenties, for a career in journalism for major city
        newspapers and radio stations. As a youngster, Peter was my faithful companion in the newsroom, pounding away on
        the typewriter with his little fingers, just like Dad.<br/><br/>
        Yet the invitation to join Peter in Romania was totally unexpected. My son and I had grown apart emotionally by
        geographic distance and the demands of his busy career and family life. He was a husband and father of three. My wife
        Dalia and I saw Peter perhaps three times a year, since we live in different states. We briefly talked on the phone now
        and then. I knew little about his life, nor did he know much about mine. I had feelings of loss, an awareness of my own
        mortality, and the sense that time was running out for my firstborn and me. But I could never express any of it to
        Peter. He is not one for sentimentality.<br/><br/>
        Our trip to Romania began on a clear, crisp fall day at Kennedy Airport in New Y ork. “We’re going to spend so
        much time together, you’ll be sick of me,” Peter said. I assured him this would never happen. Of course, I didn’t know
        how he would come to feel about me.<br/><br/>
        But then, above the clouds, Peter began to open up to me. My son, outwardly so self-confident, said he felt that
        nothing he was writing was ever good enough. He always thought he could have done better. He also said that he had a
        great need for the approval of others. And sometimes he feared that his flow of ideas would suddenly dry up.<br/><br/>
        I felt badly for him, and yet I was joyous. My son was sharing himself with me as he used to when he was at home. I
        never shared myself with my own father. As my son and I became distant, I knew how shut out my father must have
        felt. Now I was exhilarated; my son was coming back to me.<br/><br/>
        The morning after arriving in Bucharest we drove to the set. In the heart of plowed Romanian fields and small farm
        houses, there emerged a town from another time and place - the old American West: The General Store, Miss Kitty’s
        saloon, the town bank, horses at the post.<br/><br/>
        Since Peter’s films were a blend of westerns and science fiction, a space ship was parked at the train station. The
        Wild West bank was equipped with an automated teller machine.<br/><br/>
        “Incredible,” I exclaimed. “This is wonderful, Peter. You have such great imagination.”<br/><br/>
        He smiled. “You know how when children play, they want their parents to see them?” he said. “They want to say to
        their parents, ‘Look at me, Mom, look at me, Dad.”’<br/><br/>
        I put my hands on his shoulders. “And you brought me here, to say, ‘Look at me Dad, look at what I’ve
        accomplished’?”<br/><br/>
        Peter nodded.<br/><br/>
        At that moment, layer upon layer of emotional distance, of defenses built against disappointment and hurt, began
        to peel off. I felt a wonderful sense of relief, as if a phy sical burden had been lifted off my chest. I realized how much he
        loved me, as I loved him, and how he needed my acknowledgment and approval. I told him then how impressed I was
        with all he had accomplished, and how proud I was of him.<br/><br/>
        In the days that followed, Peter and I talked a great deal, about his life, his hopes and dreams. And I told him
        about mine. There, in Romania, it was as if we were back home again and he was my kid once more.<br/><br/>
        My big day came about halfway through our eleven-daystay. Peter gave me tips on how to act in front of the
        camera. Clad in garb, complete with a cowboy hat, leather gloves and boots, I was installed in the General Store to do
        some shopping.<br/><br/>
        “Action!” yelled the director. It was a magic word.<br/><br/>
        A seven-foot actor dressed in black, wearing a tall black hat, entered. He played a funeral director with psy chic
        powers, and his appearance often meant death would soon follow.<br/><br/>
        Upon seeing him, I stammered to the shopkeeper, “I... I think I’ll come back later.” With a great deal of noise, I
        dropped the canned goods I had selected on the wooden floor as I dashed out.<br/><br/>
        Next came the close-up. “That’s a take,” the director shouted. Then he, cast and crew applauded. Leading the
        applause was my son.<br/><br/>
        Peter thoughtfully obtained the hat and gloves of my costume as mementos for me. On our last evening, as cast
        members were writing kind words on the title page of my script, I asked Peter to do the same.<br/><br/>
        “I can’t put my feelings into just a few words,” he said.<br/><br/>
        But he would put some of them into the diary he kept during the trip. He was making his final entry on his laptop
        computer an hour before we were to land at Kennedy.<br/><br/>
        “When I started the diary, I referred to you as my father,” Peter turned to me and said. “As time went on, I began
        referring to you as Dad. Why do you think that is?”<br/><br/>
        Tears filled my eyes. I wanted to reach over and hug him, right there, on the plane. But I was afraid to embarrass
        him, and perhaps myself. So instead, I took his hand in mine and squeezed it. Tight. Real tight.<br/><br/>
        My son squeezed my hand in return.

        contentEn: `When my son Ryan was six years old and in first grade, his teacher, Nancy, talked to his
        class about developing countries and how they could help people, particularly
        children, in other parts of the world. She explained that besides not having toys or
        enough food, some of them didn’t even have clean water. For these children sitting in
        their comfortable classroom in Kemptville, Ontario, the idea of children not having
        any toys, or enough food or water, had an enormous impact.<br/><br/>
        The principal had distributed a list that showed the costs of buying supplies in developing countries. A penny
        would buy a pencil, a dollar a hot meal, two dollars a blanket. Seventy dollars would buy a well. When Ryan heard
        people died because they didn’t have clean water, he was deeply affected. He came home that day and insisted he
        needed seventy dollars for class the next morning.<br/><br/>
        We thought it was very nice that he wanted to do something important, but we didn’t take it seriously. My
        husband Mark and I both do volunteer work, but Ryan was only six years old - and we just brushed it off.<br/><br/>
        The next day, Ryan came home very upset because he hadn’t been able to take the seventy dollars to school.<br/><br/>
        People were dying, and he insisted he needed that money.<br/><br/>
        Mark and I discussed it, then explained to Ryan that seventy dollars was a lot of money. If he was really interested
        in doing something, however, he could earn it.<br/><br/>
        I drew a little thermometer on a sheet of paper and said, “This is how many dollars it takes to get to seventy, and if
        you’re prepared to earn it, we’ll give you extra chores.” He happily agreed, so we put an old cookie tin on top of the
        refrigerator and started giving him chores.<br/><br/>
        Well, Ryan worked and worked and worked. With every two dollars he earned, he got to fill in another line on the
        thermometer, then throw his money into the cookie tin. He never stopped working. Ryan vacuumed, washed windows
        and much more.<br/><br/>
        He did chores for the neighbors and his grandparents, picked up brush after an ice storm - and it all went right into
        the cookie tin! When we realized he was really serious, we thought, Okay, what will we do with the money once he’s
        raised it? We had no clue. After four months, Ryan was nearing his goal.<br/><br/>
        I called a girlfriend at CUSO (a Canadian International Development Agency ) and asked her for suggestions
        “We can take it here at CUSO,” she replied. “But let me look around for a more appropriate organization that might
        specifically build wells.”<br/><br/>
        Brenda contacted WaterCan in Ottawa and set up a meeting for us. WaterCan is a Canadian nonprofit organization
        providing clean water and sanitation to people in developing countries.<br/><br/>
        In April 1998 we went for our meeting, and Ryan brought his cookie tin full of money. Nicole, the executive
        director and Helen, her assistant, were very gracious. They thanked him and told him how important his donation was.<br/><br/>
        Then they told us it would cost a lot more than \$7 0 to build a well - in fact, it would cost \$2,000.<br/><br/>
        Ryan wasn’t concerned and replied simply, “That’s okay. I’ll just do more chores!”<br/><br/>
        News about what Ryan was doing got out, and soon we were getting calls from the media. When the Ottawa Citizen
        did a story on Ryan’s well, we began to receive donations at least once a week. People from all over were catching
        Ryan’s dream and were inspired to give.<br/><br/>
        A high school in Cornwall, Ontario, sold bottled water and presented WaterCan with a check for Ryan’s well for
        \$228. Central Children’s Choir from Ottawa donated \$1,000. The Ground Water Association of Eastern Ontario
        donated \$2,7 00. It wasn’t long before Ryan had raised more than enough money for his well.<br/><br/>
        Ryan was invited to a board meeting to discuss details of the well. Gizaw, the engineer from Uganda who would
        design and build the well, was also invited to that meeting. Ryan asked him: “How long would it take to build the well?
        Where would it be built?” When Gizaw asked Ryan where he would like the well to be built, Ryan decided that it would
        be best near a school.<br/><br/>
        Ryan’s well was built beside Angolo Primary School in Uganda, Africa, and was dedicated in April of 1999!<br/><br/>
        But Ryan’s efforts had only begun. Ryan’s entire school embraced his dream. First, a fund-raising project raised
        about \$1,400. Then the school organized a pen pal letter-writing campaign between Ryan’s class and the students at
        Angolo Primary School.<br/><br/>
        CTV and several big newspapers did lead stories on that project and interviewed Ryan. I was concerned about if
        he was interested in all the attention. When I asked Ryan’s teacher, Lynn, about it she said, “I don’t think so. Ryan
        never talks about it unless someone asks.” She then told me the class had been raising funds throughout the year, and a
        water can had been placed on her desk. One dayshe’d walked into her classroom and found Ryan was at the water can,
        picking his picture off the side. “I already have enough money for my well,” he explained. “This well will be for my
        class.”<br/><br/>
        One day Ryan said, “I’m going to keep working until everyone in Africa has clean water.” I thought, Oh, boy! I’d
        heard about encouraging your children to be confident and dream big dreams, but... I didn’t want to say -like I
        almost had when he asked for the seventy dollars - that he couldn’t make a difference. The truth was, he already had!
        One night Ryan shared with us that one day, he would love to actually see his well. I replied, “Ryan, you will see
        your well. You might be twelve by the time we save enough money to visit Africa, but I promise you, will see your
        well.”<br/><br/>
        One day, when Ryan was over visiting our neighbors, he announced, “When I’m twelve, I’m going to go over to
        Uganda and see my well.” He wrote his pen pal Jimmy Akana in Uganda saying, “When I’m twelve, I’m coming to see
        you.” This news spread like wildfire through the schools in Uganda, and all the children wrote back to their pen pals in
        Ryan’s class asking, “Are you coming with Ryan? Did you know Ryan is coming when he’s twelve?”<br/><br/>
        When Jimmy wrote back, he said, “I always drink from your well and I thank you for the well. We will be so happy
        to see you in Uganda when you’re twelve.”<br/><br/>
        At New years, our neighbors, the Paynters, presented Ryan with a very special gift - enough air miles to fly three
        people halfway to Uganda to visit Jimmy and his well! The Ottawa Citizen then posted a request for more air miles. As
        a result of those donations, and some help from WaterCan, my husband and I were able to join Ryan. There, we would
        all see the amazing well that has allowed Ryan’s friends in Uganda to have fresh, clean water everyday.<br/><br/>
        On July 27, 2000, we arrived by truck in Angolo, Uganda. As we got close, a small group of children saw us and
        began calling out, “Ryan! Ryan!”<br/><br/>
        Ryan was astonished that they knew his name.<br/><br/>
        “Everybody for a hundred kilometers knows your name, Ryan,” our companion Gizaw Shibru announced.<br/><br/>
        As we rounded a bend, we were stunned to see a crowd of about 5,000 children from nearby schools lining the
        roadside, waiting for us. As our truck approached, they excitedly began clapping rhy thmically in welcome!
        Ryan managed to wave a shy hello. Ryan’s pen pal, Jimmy, was waiting for him, and after they said hello, Jimmy
        took Ryan’s hand and led him to the well for the ribbon-cutting ceremony. As we approached Ryan’s well, we were
        overcome with joy. It was adorned with flowers, and on the concrete was inscribed: “Ryan’s Well: Formed by Ryan H
        for Comm. of Angolo.”<br/><br/>
        A village elder spoke words of appreciation: “Look around at our children. You can see they ’re healthy. This is
        because of Ryan and our friends in Canada. For us, water is life.”<br/><br/>
        Ryan has also raised money for drilling equipment so that all districts can experience having clean, life-giving
        water. To date, Ryan has raised over \$100,000.<br/><br/>
        Ryan is now eleven years old and still going strong. His dream has changed the lives of so many people, most of
        whom we will never meet. That special day in Uganda was one of the happiest days of my life, and it will live in my
        heart forever. Ryan ended that special day the same as usual, with his nightly prayer: “I wish for everyone in Africa to
        have clean water.” Ryan has shown me what the power of dreams can do.

        enough to say definitely what is
        and what is not possible`,
        author: `Art E. Berg`,
        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `At the age of twenty, I was happier than I had ever been before in my life. I was active
        phy sically : I was a competitive water-skier and snow-skier and played golf, tennis,
        basketball and volleyball. I even bowled on a league. I ran nearly everyday. I had just
        started a new tennis court construction company, so my financial future looked exciting
        and bright. I was engaged to the most beautiful woman in the world. Then the tragedy
        occurred - or at least some called it that.<br/><br/>
        I awoke with a sudden jolt to the sound of twisting metal and breaking glass. As quickly as it all started, it was quiet
        again. Opening my eyes, my whole world was darkness. As my senses began to return, I could feel the warmth of blood
        covering my face. Then the pain. It was excruciating and overwhelming. I could hear voices calling my name as I
        slipped away again into unconsciousness.<br/><br/>
        Leaving my family in California on a beautiful Christmas evening, I had headed for Utah with a friend of mine. I
        was going there to spend the rest of the holidays with my finance, Dallas. We were to finish our upcoming wedding
        plans - our marriage was to be in five short weeks. I drove for the first eight hours of the trip, then, being somewhat
        tired and my friend having rested during that time, I climbed from the driver’s seat into the back passenger seat. I
        fastened my seat belt, and my friend drove away into the dark. After driving for another hour and a half, he fell asleep
        at the wheel. The car hit a cement abutment, went up and over the top of it, and rolled down the side of the road a
        number of times.<br/><br/>
        When the car finally came to a stop, I was gone. I had been ejected from the vehicle and had broken my neck. I
        was paraly zed from the chest down. Once I was taken by ambulance to a hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada, the doctor
        announced that I was now a quadriplegic. I lost the use of my feet and legs. I lost the use of my stomach muscles and
        two out of my three major chest muscles. I lost the use of my right triceps. I lost most of the use and strength in my
        shoulders and arms. And I lost the complete use of my hands.<br/><br/>
        This is where my new life began.<br/><br/>
        The doctors said I would have to dream new dreams and think new thoughts. They said because of my new
        phy sical condition, I would never work again - I was pretty excited about that one, though, because only 93 percent of
        those in my condition don’t work. They told me that I would never drive again; that for the rest of my life I would be
        completely dependent on others to eat, get dressed or even to get from place to place. They said that I should never
        expect to get married because... who would want me? They concluded that I would never again play in any kind of
        athletic sport or competitive activity. For the first time in my young life, I was really afraid. I was afraid that what they
        said might really be true.<br/><br/>
        Whilelying in that hospital bed in Las Vegas, I wondered where all my hopes and dreams had gone. I wondered if I
        would ever be made whole again. I wondered if I would work, get married, have a family and enjoy any of the activities
        of life that had previously brought me such joy.<br/><br/>
        During this critical time of doubts and fears, when my whole world seemed so dark, my mother came to my bedside and whispered in my ear, “Art, while the difficult takes time... the impossible just takes a little longer.” Suddenly a
        once darkened room began to fill with the light of hope and faith that tomorrow would be better.<br/><br/>
        Since hearing those words eleven years ago, I am now president of my own company. I am a professional speaker
        and a published author - Some Miracles Take Time.I travel more than 200,000 miles a year sharing the message of
        The Impossible Just Takes a Little Longer to Fortune 500 companies, national associations, sales organizations and
        youth groups, with some audiences exceeding 10,000 people. In 1992, I was named the Young Entrepreneur of the
        Year by the Small Business Administration for a six-state region. In 1994, Success magazine honored me as one of the
        Great Comebacks of the Year. These are dreams that have come true for me in my life. These dreams came true not in
        spite of my circumstances... but, perhaps, because of them.<br/><br/>
        Since that day I have learned to drive. I go where I want to go and I do what I want to do. I am completely
        independent and I take care of myself. Since that day I have had feeling return to my body and have gained back some
        of the use and function of my right triceps.<br/><br/>
        I got married to that same beautiful and wonderful girl a year and a half after that fateful day. In 1992, Dallas, my
        wife was named Mrs. Utah and was third runner-up to Mrs. USA! We have two children - a three- year-old daughter
        named McKenzie Raeanne and a one-month-old son named Dalton Arthur - the joys of our lives.<br/><br/>
        I have also returned to the world of sports. I have learned to swim, scuba dive and parasail - as far as I know I am
        the first quadriplegic of record to parasail. I have learned to snow ski. I have also learned to play rugby. I figure they
        can’t hurt me any worse! I also race wheelchairs and marathons. On July 10, 1993, I became the first quadriplegic in
        the world to race thirty-two miles in seven days between Salt Lake City and St. George, Utah -probably not one of the
        brightest things I have ever done, but certainly one of the most difficult.<br/><br/>
        Why have I done all of these things? Because a long time ago I chose to listen to the voice of my mother and to my
        heart rather than to the concourse of dissenting voices around me, which included medical professionals. I decided
        that my current circumstances did not mean I had to let go of my dreams. I found a reason to hope again. I learned
        that dreams are never destroyed by circumstances; dreams are born in the heart and mind, and only there can they
        ever die. Because while the difficult takes time, the impossible just takes a little longer`

        name: `The cowboy’s story`,
        title: `It never occurred to me that I couldn’t do it.
        I always knew that if I worked hard enough, I could`,
        author: `Larry Winget`,
        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `When I started my telecommunication company, I knew I was going to need
        salespeople to help me expand the business. I put the word out that I was looking for
        qualified salespeople and began the interviewing process. The salesperson I had in
        mind was experienced in the telemarketing communications industry, knew the local
        market, had experience with the various types of sy stems available, had a
        professional demeanor and was a self-starter. I had very little time to train a person, so it was
        important that the sales-person I hired could “hit the ground running.”<br/><br/>
        During the tiresome process of interviewing prospective salespeople, into my office walked a cowboy. I knew he
        was a cowboy by the way he was dressed. He had on corduroy pants and a corduroy jacket that didn’t match the pants;
        a short-sleeved snap-button shirt; a tie that came about halfway down his chest with a knot bigger than my fist;
        cowboy boots; and a baseball cap. You can imagine what I was thinking: “Not what I had in mind for my new
        company.” He sat down in front of my desk, took off his cap and said, “Mister, I’d just seen a chance to be a success in
        the telephone business.” And that’s just how he said it, too: business.<br/><br/>
        I was trying to figure out a way to tell this fellow, without being too blunt, that he just wasn’t what I had in mind at
        all. I asked him about his background. He said he had a degree in agriculture from Oklahoma State University and that
        he had been a ranch hand in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, for the past few years during the summers. He announced that was
        all over now, he was ready to be a success in “biness,” and he would just “seen a chance.”<br/><br/>
        We continued to talk. He was so focused on success and how he would “seen the a chance” that I decided to give
        him a chance. I told him that I would spend two days with him. In those two days I would teach him every thing I
        thought he needed to know to sell one type of very small telephone sy stem. At the end of those two days he would be
        on his own. He asked me how much money I thought he could make.<br/><br/>
        I told him, “Looking like you look and knowing what you know, the best you can do is about \$1,000 per month.”<br/><br/>
        I went on to explain that the average commission on the small telephone sy stems he would be selling was
        approximately \$250 per sy stem. I told him if he would see 100 prospects per month, that he would sell four of those
        prospects a telephone sy stem. Selling four telephone sy stems would give him \$1,000. I hired him on straight
        commission with no base salary.<br/><br/>
        He said that sounded great to him because the most he had ever made was \$400 per month as a ranch hand and
        he was ready to make some money. The next morning, I sat him down to cram as much of the telephone “biness” I
        could into a twenty-two-year-old cowboy with no business experience, no telephone experience and no sales
        experience. He looked like any thing but a professional salesperson in the telecommunications business. In fact, he had
        none of the qualities I was looking for in an employ ee, except one: He had an incredible focus on being a success.<br/><br/>
        At the end of two days of training, Cowboy (that’s what I called him then, and still do) went to his cubicle. He took
        out a sheet of paper and wrote down four things:<br/><br/>
        l. I will be a success in business.<br/>
        2. I will see 100 people per month.<br/>
        3. I will sell four telephone sy stems per month.<br/>
        4. I will make \$1,000 per month.<br/><br/>
        He placed this sheet of paper on the cubicle wall and started to work.<br/><br/>
        At the end of the first month, he hadn’t sold four telephone sy stems. However, at the end of his first ten days, he
        had sold seven telephone sy stems..<br/><br/>
        At the end of his first year, Cowboy hadn’t earned \$12,000 in commissions. Instead, he had earned over
        \$60,000 in commissions..<br/><br/>
        He was indeed amazing. One day, he walked into my office with a contract and payment on a telephone sy stem. I
        asked him how he had sold this one. He said, “I just told her, ‘Ma’am, if it don’t do nothing but ring and you answer it,
        it’s a heck of a lot prettier than that one you got.’ She bought it.”.<br/><br/>
        The woman wrote him a check in full for the telephone sy stem, but Cowboy wasn’t really sure I would take a
        check, so he drove her to the bank and had her get cash to pay for the sy stem. He carried thousand-dollar bills into my
        office and said, “Larry, did I do good?” I assured him that he did good!.<br/><br/>
        After three years, he owned half of my company. At the end of another year, he owned three other companies. At
        that time we separated as business partners. He was driving a \$32,000 black pickup truck. He was wearing \$600
        cow-boy -cut suits, \$500 cowboy boots and a three-carat horseshoe-shaped diamond ring. He had become a success
        in “business.”.<br/><br/>
        What made Cowboy a success? Was it because he was a hard worker? That helped. Was it because he was smarter
        than everyone else? No. He knew nothing about the telephone business when he started. So what was it? I believe it
        was because he knew the Ya Gotta’s for Success:.<br/><br/>
        He was focused on success. He knew that’s what he wanted and he went after it..<br/><br/>
        He took responsibility. He took responsibility for where he was, who he was and what he was (a ranch hand)..<br/><br/>
        Then he took action to make it different..<br/><br/>
        He made a decision to leave the ranch in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, and to look for opportunities to become a
        success..<br/><br/>
        He changed.There was no way that he could keep doing the things that he had been doing and receive different
        results. And he was willing to do what was necessary to make success happen for him..<br/><br/>
        He had vision and goals. He saw himself as a success. He also had written down specific goals. He wrote down
        the four items that he intended to accomplish and put them on the wall in front of him. He saw those goals everyday
        and focused on their accomplishment..<br/><br/>
        He put action to his goals and stayed with it even when it got tough. It wasn’t always easy for him. He
        experienced slumps like everyone does. He got more doors slammed in his face and telephones in his ear than any
        sales-person I have ever known. But he never let it stop him. He kept on going..<br/><br/>
        He asked. Boy, did he ask! First he asked me for a chance, then he asked nearly all the people he came across if
        they wanted to buy a telephone sy stem from him. And his asking paid off. That simply means that if you ask enough,
        eventually someone will say yes..<br/><br/>
        He cared. He cared about me and his customers. He discovered that when he cared more about taking care of his
        customers than he cared about taking care of himself, it wasn’t long before he didn’t have to worry about taking care of
        himself..<br/><br/>
        Most of all, Cowboy  started everyday as a winner! He hit the front door expecting something good to
        happen. He believed that things were going to go his way regardless of what happened. He had no expectation of
        failure, only an expectation of success. And I’ve found that when you expect success and take action on that
        expectation, you almost always get success..<br/><br/>
        Cowboy has made millions of dollars. He has also lost it all, only to get it all back again. In his life as in mine, it has
        been that once you know and practice the principles of success, they will work for you again and again..<br/><br/>
        He can also be an inspiration to you. He is proof that it’s not environment or education or technical skills and
        ability that make you a success. He proves that it takes more: It takes the principles we so often overlook or take for
        granted. These are the principles of the Ya Gotta’s for Success.`

        author: `Gerald Moore`,
        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `Coming home from school that dark winter’s dayso long ago, I was filled with anticipation.
        I had a new issue of my favorite sports magazine tucked under my arm and the house to
        myself. Dad was at work, my sister was away, and Mother wouldn’t be home from her new
        job for an hour. I bounded up the steps, burst into the living room and flipped on a light..<br/><br/>
        I was shocked into stillness by what I saw. Mother pulled into a tight ball, with her face in her hands, sat at the far
        end of the couch. She was crying. I had never seen her cry..<br/><br/>
        I approached cautiously and touched her shoulder. “Mother?” I asked. “What’s happened?”.<br/><br/>
        She took a long breath and managed a weak smile. “It’s nothing, really. Nothing important. Just that I’m going to
        lose this new job. I can’t type fast enough.”.<br/><br/>
        “But you’ve only been there three days,” I said. “You’ll catch on.” I repeated a line she had spoken to me a
        hundred times when I was having trouble learning or doing something important to me..<br/><br/>
        “No,” she said sadly. “There’s no time for that. I can’t carry my end of the load. I’m making everyone in the office
        work twice as hard.”.<br/><br/>
        “They ’re just giving you too much work,” I said, hoping to find injustice where she saw failure. She was too honest
        to accept that..<br/><br/>
        “I always said I could do any thing I set my mind to,” she said, “and I still think I can in most things. But I can’t do
        this.”.<br/><br/>
        I felt helpless and out of place. At age sixteen I still assumed Mother could do any thing. Some years before, when
        we sold our ranch and moved to town, Mother had decided to open a day nursery. She had no training, but that didn’t
        stand in her way. She sent away for correspondence courses in child care, did the lessons and in six months formally
        qualified herself for the task. It wasn’t long before she had a full enrollment and a waiting list. Parents praised her, and
        the children proved by their reluctance to leave in the afternoon that she had won their affection. I accepted all this as
        a perfectly normal instance of Mother’s ability..<br/><br/>
        But neither the nursery nor the motel my parents bought later had provided enough income to send my sister and
        me to college. I was a high-school sophomore when we sold the motel. In two years, I would be ready for college. In
        three more, my sister would want to go. Time was running out, and Mother was frantic for ways to save money. It was
        clear that Dad could do no more than he was doing already - farming eighty acres in addition to holding a full-time job..<br/><br/>
        Like many kids of sixteen, I wanted my parents’ time and attention, but it never occurred to me that they might
        have needs and problems of their own. In fact, I understood nothing of their lives because I looked only at my own..<br/><br/>
        A few months after we’d sold the motel, Mother arrived home with a used typewriter. It skipped between certain
        letters and the keyboard was soft. At dinner that night I pronounced the machine a “piece of junk.”.<br/><br/>
        “That’s all we can afford,” Mother said. “It’s good enough to learn on.” And from that day on, as soon as the table
        was cleared and the dishes were done, Mother disappeared into her sewing room to practice. The slow tap, tap, tap
        went on some nights until midnight..<br/><br/>
        It was nearly Christmas when I heard her tell Dad one night that a good job was available at the radio station. “It
        would be such interesting work,” she said. “But this typing isn’t coming along very fast.”.<br/><br/>
        “If you want the job, go ask for it,” Dad encouraged her..<br/><br/>
        I was not the least bit surprised, or impressed, when Mother got the job. But she was ecstatic..<br/><br/>
        Monday, after her first day at work, I could see that the excitement was gone. Mother looked tired and drawn. I
        responded by ignoring her..<br/><br/>
        Tuesday, Dad made dinner and cleaned the kitchen. Mother stayed in her sewing room, practicing. “Is Mother all
        right?” I asked Dad..<br/><br/>
        “She’s having a little trouble with her typing,” he said. “She needs to practice. I think she’d appreciate it if we all
        helped out a bit more.”.<br/><br/>
        “I already do,” I said, immediately on guard..<br/><br/>
        “I know you do,” Dad said evenly. “And you may have to do more. You might just remember that she is working
        primarily so you can go to college.”.<br/><br/>
        I honestly didn’t care. In a pique, I called a friend and went out to get a soda. When I came home the house was
        dark, except for the band of light showing under Mother’s door. It seemed to me that her typing had gotten even
        slower. I wished she would just forget the whole thing..<br/><br/>
        My shock and embarrassment at finding Mother in tears on Wednesday was a perfect index of how little I
        understood the pressures on her. Sitting beside her on the couch, I began very slowly to understand..<br/><br/>
        “I guess we all have to fail sometime,” Mother said quietly. I could sense her pain and the tension of holding back
        the strong emotions that were interrupted by my arrival. Suddenly, something inside me turned. I reached out and put
        my arms around her..<br/><br/>
        She broke then. She put her face against my shoulder and sobbed. I held her close and didn’t try to talk. I knew I
        was doing what I should, what I could and that it was enough. In that moment, feeling Mother’s back racked with
        emotion, I understood for the first time her vulnerability. She was still my mother, but she was something more: a
        person like me, capable of fear and hurt and failure. I could feel her pain as she must have felt mine on a thousand
        occasions when I had sought comfort in her arms..<br/><br/>
        Then it was over. Wiping away the tears, Mother stood and faced me. “Well, Son, I may be a slow typist, but I’m
        not a parasite and I won’t keep a job I can’t do. I’m going to ask tomorrow if I can finish out the week. Then I’ll resign.”.<br/><br/>
        And that’s what she did. Her boss was sorry about her. They parted with mutual respect, he offering a week’s pay
        and she refusing it. A week later Mother took a job selling dry goods at half the salary the radio station had offered..<br/><br/>
        “It’s a job I can do,” she said simply. But the evening practice sessions on the old green typewriter continued. I had a
        very different feeling now when I passed her door at night and heard her tapping away. I knew there was something
        more going on in there than a woman learning to type..<br/><br/>
        When I left for college two years later, Mother had an office job with better pay and more responsibility. I have to
        believe that in some strange way she learned as much from her moment of defeat as I did, because several years later,
        when I finished school and proudly accepted a job as a newspaper reporter, she had already been a reporter with our
        hometown paper for six months..<br/><br/>
        Mother and I never spoke again about the afternoon when she broke down. But more than once, when I failed on a
        first attempt and was tempted by pride or frustration to scrap something I truly wanted, I remember the time while
        she learned to type. In seeing her weakness, I had not only learned to appreciate her strengths, I had discovered some
        of my own..<br/><br/>
        Not long ago, I helped Mother celebrate her sixty-second birthday. I made dinner for my parents and cleaned up
        the kitchen afterward. Mother came in to visit while I worked, and I was reminded of the day years before when she
        had come home with that terrible old typewriter. “By the way,” I said, “whatever happened to that monster
        typewriter?”.<br/><br/>
        “Oh, I still have it,” she said. “It’s a memento, you know... of the day you realized your mother was human. Things
        are a lot easier when people know you’re human.”.<br/><br/>
        I had never guessed that she saw what happened to me that day. I laughed at myself. “Someday,” I said, “I wish
        you would give me that machine.”.<br/><br/>
        “I will,” she said, “but on one condition.”.<br/><br/>
        “What’s that?”.<br/><br/>
        “That you never have it fixed. It is nearly impossible to type on that machine, and that’s the way it served this
        family best.”.<br/><br/>
        I smiled at the thought. “And another thing,” she said. “Never put off hugging someone when you feel like it. You
        may miss the chance forever.”.<br/><br/>
        I put my arms around her and hugged her and felt a deep gratitude for that moment, for all the moments of joy she
        had given me over the years. “Happy birthday!” I said..<br/><br/>
        The old green typewriter sits in my office now, unrepaired. It is a memento, but what it recalls for me is not quite
        what it recalled for Mother. When I’m having trouble with a story and think about giving up, or when I start to feel
        sorry for myself and think things should be easier for me, I roll a piece of paper into that cranky old machine and type,
        word by painful word, just the way Mother did. What I remember then is not her failure, but her courage, the courage
        to go ahead..<br/><br/>
        It’s the best memento I’ve had.

        contentEn: `She staggered off the practice ice supported by some of her skating-team friends. I hurried
        over to give Heidi her jacket and to brace her until we could find a seat. At fifteen, she had
        been living with cancer for a year. We’d learned the news just after returning from Chicago,
        where she’d won her first gold medal in an international competition..<br/><br/>
        Then came the tests and the surgery. Through it all, what mattered to her most was that she
        retain her ability to skate. Fortunately, her doctor agreed to let her skate as much as she was able..<br/><br/>
        Heidi’s friend Greg helped me take off her skates. All of the children were initially frightened by Heidi’s plight, but
        gradually pitched in to help keep her safe..<br/><br/>
        “Is she all right?” Greg asked..<br/><br/>
        “Yes, she just needs a nice nap before we can get her to the car,” I explained..<br/><br/>
        Happy children swirled around me as Heidi slept away. They all tried to be quiet, but their exuberance for the
        upcoming Key stone State Games was evident. How I wished those days would return for Heidi..<br/><br/>
        Heidi had been working hard on her programs and was determined to compete, but now the deadline had passed. I
        woke her up and we began our journey to the car. “Mom, Coach Barb says I am skating my program well. I want to go
        to the State Games.”.<br/><br/>
        Pain shot through my heart. When I told her the registration deadline had passed, she said her coach could
        probably still get her in. “Mom,” she pleaded, “I don’t expect a medal. I just want to go there and be normal for a
        couple of days. Is that so bad?” A sob escaped her..<br/><br/>
        “Let’s ask the doctor,” I said, uncertain..<br/><br/>
        The next day at her checkup she filled the doctor in on all the details of the State Games..<br/><br/>
        “I’ll tell you what,” he responded. “It’s okay with me if it is okay with your mom, but you’ll have to get permission
        to miss your radiation treatments.”.<br/><br/>
        I added something else to the list: “You have to eat right, sleep right and take good care of yourself.”.<br/><br/>
        “I will, I promise!” she responded..<br/><br/>
        After getting permission from the oncologist and sending in a last-minute registration form, Heidi was set to go to
        the State Games. Now it was the big night and Heidi was about to alight on the ice for her freesty le routine. I prayed..<br/><br/>
        The speakers announced her name and I steadied my hand on the camera as she flowed across the ice gracefully
        like her old self. Proudly, she took up her stance. Steel Magnolias’ theme song filled the arena and she took off for a full
        performance..<br/><br/>
        She picked her toe into the ice and lifted up into a jump. She was so high that a momentary look of fear crossed her
        face. I cringed, whispering, “Please God, don’t let her break any thing on the landing.”.<br/><br/>
        She landed perfectly leg out behind her just like the pros. Her face bore a huge smile as if to say “I did it!” She tore
        into her next move as the audience went wild. “Go Heidi!” echoed around the arena. She leaned into her ultimate
        move, the eagle posture, perfectly done..<br/><br/>
        The stands erupted with joy ful noise. None of us could believe it. Another huge jump! She was garnering points for
        the team. She glided into a lovely spiral, heavy boot held high like a flag of victory. Her cheeks were pink with effort
        and she was beaming with pride. Heidi had outskated her best!.<br/><br/>
        She exited victoriously into her coach’s arms. Barb grabbed her in a huge hug, crying as they savored this
        incredible moment. Then her joy turned to shock. Heidi lay lifeless in her arms..<br/><br/>
        The arena quieted. I ran..<br/><br/>
        I caught them as Heidi’s weight began to overpower Barb. I backed to the bleachers and rested over against them.
        Arms reached to help. I laid her carefully down and felt her neck for a pulse. She had one.
        Everyone waited in shock as I checked her over..<br/><br/>
        The quiet was suddenly shattered by a snore! Bedlam erupted. Applause ripped through the rafters of the frigid
        arena. Parents of her rivals shared their blankets as Heidi took a well-deserved nap. She was still sound asleep when
        her teammates ran over to congratulate her. She had earned the gold medal in the freesty le division!`

        contentEn: `The young boy who had been wearing a steel brace on his left leg for the last four months
        walked through the front door of his home with a newly purchased puppy in his arms.<br/><br/>
        The dog didn’t have a hip socket and, when placed on the floor, it walked with a serious
        limp. The boy’s selection of a phy sically challenged puppy intrigued his parents, for he
        had been downand- out. But with his new companion at his side, they sensed a newly revitalized
        spirit of hope and enthusiasm emerging from his soul.<br/><br/>
        The next day the young boy and his mom went to see a veterinarian to find out how he could best help his little
        dog. The doctor explained that if he stretched and massaged his puppy’s leg every morning and then walked with him
        at least one mile per day, the muscles around his missing hip would eventually strengthen to the point of no pain and
        less of a limp.<br/><br/>
        Although the dog whimpered and barked out his discomfort, and the boy winced and hassled with his own leg
        brace, for the next two months they religiously kept to their rehabilitation regimen. By the third month they were
        walking three miles every morning before school began and they were both walking without pain.<br/><br/>
        One Saturday morning when returning from their workout, a cat leaped out of the bushes and startled the dog.<br/><br/>
        Breaking loose of the leash, the dog darted into oncoming traffic. With a speeding truck only seconds away, the boy ran
        into the street, dove for his dog, and rolled into the gutter. He was too late. The dog was hit and bleeding profusely
        from the mouth. As the boy lay there crying and hugging his dying dog, he noticed that his own leg brace had broken
        off. With no time to worry about himself, he sprang to his feet, picked up his dog, cuddled it close to him and started for
        home. The dog quietly barked, giving him hope and turning the boy’s jog into an all-out, adrenaline sprint.
        His mother rushed him and his suffering pup to the pet hospital. As they anxiously waited to see if his dog would
        survive the surgery, he asked his mother why he could now walk and run.<br/><br/>
        “You had osteomy elitis, which is a disease of the bone,” she said. “It weakened and crippled your leg, which
        caused you to limp in severe pain. Your brace was for support. It wasn’t necessarily a permanent condition if you were
        willing to fight through the pain and hours of therapy. You responded well to the medication, but you always resisted
        our encouragement for phy sical therapy, and your father and I didn’t know what to do. The doctors told us you were
        about to lose your leg. Then you brought home your puppy and you seemed to understand his needs. Ironically, as
        you were helping him, you were actually helping yourself to strengthen and grow.”<br/><br/>
        Just then the operating room door slowly opened. Out walked the veterinarian with a smile on his face. “Your dog
        is going to make it,” he said.<br/><br/>
        And, the boy learned that when you lose yourself, you find yourself. It is more blessed to give, then receive`

        young Japanese was spending the weekend with his elderly grandfather. The
        rendezvous would take place at the train station, for the grandfather lived in a
        village on the other side of the mountain. The boy’s parents dropped him off,
        hugged both of them good-by e and drove away.<br/><br/>
        As the two of them waited in line to buy their tickets, the grandfather discovered that
        he had left his wallet on the previous train. He didn’t have any money. It was cold and
        blizzardy, and he asked the ticket lady if she would loan him yen valuing $50. The
        grandfather promised he would pay her back later that night.<br/><br/>
        Because of the Japanese culture’s deep and abiding respect for its elders, the ticket
        lady believed the grandfather and paid for their tickets.<br/><br/>
        An hour later, they arrived in the village. They walked 15 minutes through the horrible weather and finally
        entered the cottage. Hungry, tired, and soaking wet, the grandfather went to his drawer and retrieved some money.<br/><br/>
        “Let’s go,” he said. His grandson rebutted, “But Grandfather, I’m starving and we’re going back to the train station in
        three days. Why can’t you just pay her back then? It will cost you the price of two more round-trip tickets to go now,
        just to pay back two one-way passes.”<br/><br/>
        Putting on a overcoat and handing his grandson a wool blanket, the 80-year-old grandfather softly put his arm
        around his grandson’s shoulders and taught him the lesson of the ages. “Son, we must get there tonight before the
        counter closes and she goes home. This is not about money. This is about honor. I gave her my word, and we must
        always keep our promises!”`

        circus. Finally, there was only one family between us and the ticket counter.<br/><br/>
        There were eight children, all under the age of 12. I could tell they didn’t have a
        lot of money. Their clothes were frayed but clean, and the children were wellbehaved – all of them standing in line, two-by -two holding hands in back of the parents.
        They were jabbering about the clowns, elephants and other acts they would see that night.<br/><br/>
        I sensed they had never been to the circus before. This promised to be a highlight of their
        young lives.<br/><br/>
        The father and mother were at the head of the pack standing proud as could be, the mother looking at her husband
        as if to say, ‘You’re my knight in shining armor.” He was smiling and basking in pride, as if to reply, “You got that
        right.”<br/><br/>
        The ticket lady asked the father how many tickets he wanted. He proudly responded, “Please let me buy eight
        children tickets and two adult tickets.”<br/><br/>
        As the ticket lady quoted the price, the wife let go of her husband’s hand, her head dropped, the man’s lip began to
        quiver. The father leaned a little closer and asked, “How much did you say?”<br/><br/>
        The ticket lady again quoted the price.<br/><br/>
        The man didn’t have enough money.<br/><br/>
        How was he supposed to turn and tell his children that he couldn’t afford to take them to the circus?<br/><br/>
        Seeing what was going on, my dad put his hand into his pocket, pulled out a $20 bill and dropped it on the ground.<br/><br/>
        We were not wealthy in any sense of the word. Then my dad reached down, picked up the bill, tapped the man on the
        shoulder and said, “Excuse me, sir, this fell out of your pocket.”<br/><br/>
        The man knew what was going on. He wasn’t begging for a handout but he certainly appreciated the help in a
        desperate, heartbreaking, embarrassing situation. He looked straight into my dad’s eyes, took my dad’s hand in both of
        his and squeezed it tightly. With a tear streaming down his cheek, he replied, ‘Thank you, thank you, sir. This really
        means the world to me and my little family.’<br/><br/>
        My father and I went back to our car and drove home. We didn’t go to the circus that night, but we didn’t go
        without.<br/><br/>
        Understanding that who is right is not as important as what is right – this is the secret to effective leadership,
        management, parenting, teaching and coaching. It’s amazing how much we can accomplish if we simply focus on
        leaving everyone we meet in better shape than we found them.

        wouldn’t be around for Christmas, I wanted to make that year extra special. I thought
        the perfect gift was a grandfather clock, handbuilt by me. It was one of the things he
        had always wanted but could never afford. Although I had not built any thing of that
        complexity, I felt it would not only make my dad proud of me, but it would give him
        something from me that he could treasure.<br/><br/>
        I purchased a magnificent self-assembly kit and immediately devoted my time to the
        overwhelming task of putting to together.<br/><br/>
        Everyday after work I went to my brother’s house to secretly work on the clock. Three hours a day, six days a
        week I labored all alone, trying to figure out those complicated instructions. As it started to take form, the anticipation
        and internal excitement were almost too much to bear. I was really proud and couldn’t help visualizing how surprised,
        appreciative and amazed my dad would surely be when he unwrapped the masterpiece. On October 10, I finally
        finished the clock and wrapped it up with a big red bow, ready to be delivered in a couple of months on Christmas Eve.<br/><br/>
        The next morning I left on a trip to Washington.<br/><br/>
        Two days later at 7 :00 A.M., the phone rang in my hotel room. It was my brother. “Dad just died,” he cried.<br/><br/>
        That was a sad and brutal Christmas for me. Mom had a gorgeous Christmas tree, there were gifts galore. And
        there in the corner of my mother’s living room stood the tall, solid oak grandfather clock that I had spent 63 hours
        building. But there was no Dad! The presents meant nothing and the clock meant nothing in comparison to the loss of
        my dad.<br/><br/>
        Not a day goes by that I don’t regret the time I spent on that clock, now knowing that I should have spent those
        final, most sacred hours – all 63 of them – at my father’s side. What a fool I was to think a “thing” would make him
        happy. Things don’t make people happy. Time spent together with loved ones does!`

        Soon a couple pulled up chairs and sat down to the left of him. “You idiot. I can’t believe you locked the key in the
        room,” the man yelled at his wife. “Y eah, but you big imbecile, you forgot to bring the suntan lotion,” she replied.<br/><br/>
        The man in the sunglasses interrupted, “Can’t you see there is another key at the front desk and probably lots of
        lotion in the gift shop? Can’t you see that fighting over shallow thing is a waste of precious life?”<br/><br/>
        A mother sitting two seats away asked her son if he would please pick up a heavy box and take it to the car. He
        complained, “Oh, Mom, my back hurts, I’m tired, and ouch! I just got something in my eye!”<br/><br/>
        The man in the sunglasses turned to the lad. “Can’t you see there are people in this world who would give any thing
        just to be able to bend over and lift something?”<br/><br/>
        Just then, a woman came from behind the wall with a wheelchair. She helped hoist the paraly zed, blind man into
      the seat, rearranged his sunglasses, carefully wheeled him out the gate and extended his telescopic white cane so that
      he could tap his way back to his hotel room.<br/><br/>

        contentEn: `In the middle of his 1 1 thgrade school year, Paul’s father was transferred from his job.<br/><br/>
        Paul was forced to his spot on the varsity basketball team, his guitar teacher, his
        circle of best friends his sweetheart whom he had been dating for two years. He was
        devastated to say the least.<br/><br/>
        Then one morning Paul woke up with a plan. It was his birthday, but he was
        convinced it wouldn’t be much of a birthday because he didn’t have any friends. His plan
        would solve that.<br/><br/>
        His father reassured Paul. “It’ll be okay. You and your mother can have cake and ice
        cream this afternoon.” But Paul still was not happy.<br/><br/>
        As he was leaving for work, the father saw a young man in the neighborhood he
        barely knew. He asked the teenager to drop by that afternoon for cake and ice cream. “It’s my son’s birthday,” he said.<br/><br/>
        Later that day, the father had a phone call at work. His wife said, “I don’t know what you did, but ten kids from
        high school and two basketball coaches showed up here this afternoon for Paul’s birthday party – with gifts.”<br/><br/>
        It seems the neighbor boy told his mother he had been invited to a birthday party. She called others in the small
        party. She had occasionally seen Paul shooting baskets in the driveway, so she also phoned the basketball coaches to
        tell them he was a pretty good player and they should probably take a look.<br/><br/>
        When Paul’s father arrived home that evening, he was greeted by an excited son who said, “Dad, this has been one
        of the best days of my whole life. A girl even asked me to the girl’s choice spring dance.”<br/><br/>
        The point is it doesn’t take much to make everyday a best day for someone. All it makes is an invitation, a phone
        call, a thank-you note, a compliment or a word of encouragement.<br/><br/>
        Make today a best day for someone new in your neighborhood, or a relative who may ill, or an acquaintance. How
        much time and effort does it take on your part to let someone know you care?<br/><br/>
        Amazingly, Paul’s plan for that day was to kill himself after school. The weeks of loneliness had come to a head and
        he had been overwhelmed with despair. Luckily, things turned out the way they did.<br/><br/>
        It has been many years since then and Paul is now married with four beautiful children of his own. All of them are
        certainly glad he didn’t give up in high school!`

        contentEn: `Pain can be a signal to grow, not necessarily to suffer. Once we learn the lesson that
        the pain teaches us, the pain goes away.<br/><br/>
        I played football for 13 years. My dreams of being an NFL star were on the
        horizon when I was hit in a practice tackling drill. My eye drooped, I experienced speech
        loss, my right side was numb and my right arm dangled at my side. My arm stayed numb
        and hung helplessly at my side for well over a year. It was a phy sical injury but it affected
        my whole life. Being right-handed, I couldn’t write, and the constant pain made
        concentration on work impossible. I didn’t have control over my muscle spasms, and
        every now and then my nerves would unexpectedly twinge and contract my shoulder, which whipped my arm out!
        One night, I knocked a bowl of dressing off the diner table, and my younger brother showed up to the next meal
        wearing a batting helmet and goggles! I went to 16 of the best doctors in North America and they all concluded I would
        never recover. My dreams were shattered, my heart was broken and my life slowly fell apart.<br/><br/>
        Although I kept playing ball, I had to play with my arm strapped to my side. Eventually I had to give it up and I hit
        rock bottom. Totally confused and depressed, I decided to take my life. Obviously I didn’t and today I enjoy a 95
        percent recovery. So what three things did I learn from this experience and how does it relate to you?<br/><br/>
        1 ) I kept playing football – even though there was a chance for total paraly sis – because I was unable to let go of
        the past. We’ve all been raised to believe that what we’ve been in the past makes us who we are. No matter what our
        past has been, we have a spotless future. Only when I let go of the past did I become emotionally available to embrace
        change, dream a new dream and get on with her life. I learned that we cannot and should not a cling to the past.<br/><br/>
        Lesson: When your horse died, dismount!<br/><br/>
        2) Why would I want to quite or kill myself? I was somebody because I was an athlete. When I was injured,
        suddenly I was a nobody. Why? When we identify ourselves in terms of what we do, instead of who we are, we become
        a human doing instead of a human being. If lasting happiness is what we seek, we must realize we are not our bodies,
        our sport cars, our houses or our country club memberships. Lesson: We must be more than those superficial things!<br/><br/>
        3) Why didn’t I quit? I stopped focusing on having fame and started focusing on being whole. I started focusing on
        obvious purposes instead of just setting goals. I listened to a Zig Ziglar tape on motivation which inspired me to start
        dreaming again. He taught "If you don't have a dream, how are you going to make a dream come true?"That fired me up
        to do whatever it took to get better phy sically.<br/><br/>
        This significant awakening taught me a philosophy that affects my life each and everyday. Lesson: It is
        summarized by J. Stone, who says:<br/><br/>
        The most visible creators are those artists whose medium is life itself. The ones who express the inexpressible
        without brush, hammer, clay, or guitar. Their medium is being. Whatevern their presence touches has increased life.<br/><br/>
        They see and don't have to draw. They are the artists of being alive.

        contentEn: `A wealthy couple arrived at a resort in Mexico wearing their finest and most
        expensive jewels and clothes. The man headed to the golf course to play a round
        with his buddies. The woman had an invitation to an exclusive auction held only
        one day each year, one that was sure to have the estate antiques she was looking
        for.<br/><br/>
        She hailed a taxi to take her to the auction house. On the way, the driver lost control
        of the car and slammed into a horse-drawn cart. Animals and produce flew everywhere.<br/><br/>
        Two 10-year-old boys were thrown from the cart into the bushes.<br/><br/>
        Even though the woman had hurt her head, she scampered to see if they were all right. She found them dazed and
        bleeding. They pulled back in fright as she came close.<br/><br/>
        To gain their trust, she pulled out a photograph of her with her four small children. As they inched closer to see,
        one of the boys asked in broken English, “You mommy?”<br/><br/>
        She smiled. “Yes, me mommy.”<br/><br/>
        They immediately snuggled in on her lap and hugged her until they stopped shaking. She noticed that one was
        bleeding from a deep wound on his leg. Since there was no cloth around, she ripped a piece of her expensive dress to
        bind the gash.<br/><br/>
        The taxi was demolished and the driver went to get help. While they were waiting, an old jalopy pulled up. The
        driver said he would take them to safety - if she paid. “Gladly,” she said. But the boys didn’t want to leave the produce.<br/><br/>
        They were on their way to sell it at the market and if they arrived at home emptyhanded, they would be in trouble. The
        woman gave them each $25, which was much more than enough.<br/><br/>
        When they arrived at the hospital, they could not be admitted - until she paid. Which she did.
        Two hours later she faced the dilemma of getting the boys back home. Not wanting to risk another cab ride, she
        called for a limousine.<br/><br/>
        Delighted with their luck, the boys climbed in and began jabbering in Spanish. The woman didn’t understand a
        word, but she enjoyed their enthusiasm. Along the way, they told the driver to stop. They stepped out and helped a
        little girl right her fallen wagon. They invited her and her two little girlfriends in for a ride. The five of them talked
        nonstop.<br/><br/>
        Before they reached the village, the boys had the driver stop a few more times to pick up more little girls. And
        when they finally arrived, the boys had a car full.<br/><br/>
        When the car stopped, the children scampered out and disappeared, each with the ice cream cones.<br/><br/>
        “Why have the boys spent their precious money buying ice cream for all these strangers?” the woman asked the
        driver. “And why are they being so nice just to the young ladies?”<br/><br/>
        The driver inquired of the boys. Their smiles lit up their faces like Christmas trees. Hugging the woman tightly,
        they proudly answered, “Tenemos que cuidarles a ellas especialmente, porque algun dia ellas van a ser una madra para
        alguien.”<br/><br/>
        “What did they say?” she asked the driver.<br/><br/>
        “We must take extra special care of them, because someday – like you, lady – they ’re going to be somebody’s
        mommy!”`

        contentEn: `There was a special lady that lived on a farm in Grace, Idaho. With every challenge
        or endeavor that came her way, she always went far beyond the call of duty. She
        was a widow with nine children - the youngest age 7, the oldest 22. Instead of
        complaining of her hard life, she accepted her fate and changed the ordinary into
        the extraordinary.<br/><br/>
        No matter how bleak or serious things seemed to be, she found the positive side and a
        ray of hope. She taught her family the value of hard work and the importance of education,
        although she only went as far as fourth grade.<br/><br/>
        Once a week she picked up supplies in town. Otherwise her days were full milking the cows; making butter, cottage
        cheese and ice cream; and raising pigs, sheep, and chickens. She had a large vegetable garden, as well as gooseberry
        and raspberry bushes, strawberry vines and apple trees. She was an excellent cook and neighbors often dropped in at
        mealtime.<br/><br/>
        Once, when unexpected company arrived, she took her.22 rifle and went outside to shoot a chicken. As the gun
        went off another chicken stepped in the line of fire. The bullet went through both chickens and grazed the back of a pig.<br/><br/>
        It became a family joke - one shot to kill two chickens and skin the pig.<br/><br/>
        Her children didn’t have material wealth, but they certainly received the necessary and important things in life:
        love, spiritual guidance, concern for others, appreciation for a table filled with food and respect for the law. She was
        truly an example of all that is good.<br/><br/>
        As a young man I remember sitting at her feet while she taught me. “If you can’t saysomething nice, don’t say
        any thing at all.” And, “I’ll never throw upon the floor a crust I cannot eat, for many a little hungry one would think it
        quite a treat. Willful waste brings willful want and I may live to say, Oh, I wish I had that crust that once I threw away.”<br/><br/>
        This incredibly strong and courageous woman is my maternal grandmother, Alice Maughan. My mother is a lot
        like her mother. Many special occasions, my mother went without a new dress just so she could buy great football
        cleats for me. Many times my mother insisted that we stay home, instead of going on a summer vacation, just so I
        could stay and play on a baseball all-star team. My mother is a great cook, a spiritual giant, a church and community
        servant, and the very best mom who ever lived. She taught me right from wrong and, as far as I know, has never told a
        lie. I’ve never heard her swear or complain about her trials, heartache and pain. My dear sweet mother, Ruby
        Maughan Clark, truly is the epitome of service above self. It’s the way it was and still should be.

        Leon White was an all-conference linebacker for the Brigham Young University
        Cougars, a team that won the national championship in 1985. In the Holiday Bowl that year,
        Leon White was a one-man wrecking crew, making bone-jarring tackles, sacking the quarterback
        and intercepting passes. Leon played better than he had ever played before. The crowd went
        wild.<br/><br/>
        But Leon White wasn’t playing for the crowds or the glory. He was playing for his dad who was watching the game
        from the sidelines on the stretcher. Both of them knew this was the last game he would ever watch Leon play.<br/><br/>
        Between defensive sets Leon would hustle over and ask, “Dad, are you having a good time?” And was he ever.<br/><br/>
        His dad never stopped talking about that game or about his son right up until the moment he died from cancer a
        few days later.<br/><br/>
        Leon played a great game, but his father wasn’t proud of him because he was a great linebacker. He was proud
        because Leon was a great man and son who made his parents proud. If we could all be like Leon, many of the problems
        that exist in society today would disappear.<br/><br/>
        If the relationship between you and your parents, or you and your offspring, needs some fixing, work on it. It’s a
        worthwhile investment of time and energy.

        glory were behind me. I was still given the opportunity of watching the 1988 Summer
        Olympic Games with my parents. My dad was battling cancer at the time. My supportive
        mom served brownies and milk as we watched brawny athletes shatter world records. It
        was a very exciting and emotional time for me.<br/><br/>
        While I sat with my parents watching the track-and-field competition, cheering for the
        American athletes, my father asked, “Know what’s wrong with the world? They don’t give gold medals to the best
        parents.”<br/><br/>
        It was a very casual comment, but I could tell my father was serious.<br/><br/>
        Since my dad’s death in 1990, I’ve often wondered why our society doesn’t give prizes to the people who play the
        most important roles. Being a great parent isn’t a competition that can be translated into a dash, a dive or a contest.<br/><br/>
        Like the training of Olympic athletes, the very nature of the task takes years and years of effort, sacrifice and
        commitment. But it cannot be condensed into a 10-second dash, a four-lap swim or a pole vault.<br/><br/>
        Judges don’t raise scorecards into the air every time parents give perfect counsel or make another sacrifice for a
        child they love. If they did give out awards for parenting, I know one father and one mother I’d nominate for the gold
        medal.<br/><br/>
        How about you? Would you qualify?<br/><br/>
        If not, maybe it’s time to start training and get into shape. It’s a marathon race, and only the strong survive and

        I am writing this to you although you have been dead for many years. If you can see

        too immature to say.<br/><br/>
        It’s only after passing through the long, hard school of hard knocks - now, when my own
        hair is graying - that I understand how you felt.<br/><br/>
        I must have been a bitter trial to you. I was such a fool! I believed my own petty wisdom, and I now know how
        ridiculous it was compared to that calm, ripe, wholesome experience of yours. I now know that wisdom truly is the gift
        of the elderly. I realize there are two ways to see things: with eyesight and insight. And your insight was right on the
        mark.<br/><br/>
        Most of all I want to confess my worst sin to you: I was convinced that you didn’t understand. When I look back, I
        know that you did - perhaps better than I did myself. Your wisdom flowed around mine like an ocean surrounding an
        island. How patient you were with me. How full of longsuffering and kindness, filled with unconditional love. How
        constant were your efforts to get close to me - to win my confidence, to be my pal.<br/><br/>
        I wouldn’t let you. I couldn’t. What was it that held me aloof? I was too hard, too macho, too self-centered. I
        believed in the tough image: I wanted to be a big boy and not cry.<br/><br/>
        I wish you were here across the table from me just for an hour, so I could tell you there’s no wall between us any
        more. I understand you now, Dad, and God knows how I love you; how I needed you to remind me to remember who I
        am.<br/><br/>
        I now know what I could have done to make you happy. I know how you felt.<br/><br/>
        It won’t be long, Dad, until I am over on your side of the veil. I believe you’ll be the first to greet me, to take me by
        the hand and help me comprehend the new life that awaits me. When I see you again, I’ll spend the first thousand years
        making you realize that not one moment of your concern and yearning for me was wasted. It took a good many years
        for this prodigal son to come to know himself and his ultimate destiny. But I’ve come now. I see it all.<br/><br/>
        I know that the richest, most precious thing on Earth, and the thing least understood, is the mighty love,
        tenderness and craving to help that a father feels toward his boy. For I have a boy of my own. And it is he that makes
        me want to go back to you and get down on my knees to beg your forgiveness.<br/><br/>
        Up there somewhere in the stillness, hear me, Dad, and believe me. I did need you and still do. The ultimate
        compliment I ever receive is when somebody says, “You’re a lot like your dad.” I’m lucky to be your son.`

        He's called a lot of things, but the people who know him best call him "The Mailman"
        because he delivers. Karl Malone has stopped every NBA basketball franchise for the past
        12 years. At six-foot-nine, 260 pounds, Malone delivers almost 30 points a game for the
        Utal Jazz. He was named the league’s Most Valuable Player for the 1996-97 season and
        critics call him the greatest power forward ever to play the game.<br/><br/>
        He’s not the kind of guy you would call an angel by any means - at least not in basketball. But Malone deliversin
        other ways.<br/><br/>
        He has become a guiding spirit to one 13-year-old boy living in Salt Lake City. The two met in 1995 when the Utah
        Jazz made their annual visit to the Primary Children’s Medical Center. As Malone puts it, “The kids were all great, but
        when I met Danny, it was just different. It did something to me personally.”<br/><br/>
        Danny has terminal leukemia so Malone decided to make the dying boy’s last few weeks extra special.<br/><br/>
        “The second I met him I knew he was a Jazz fan, a Karl Malone fan. Those eyes lit up. As sick as he was he never
        had any complaints. Danny’s best day is being tired, being sore and being sick. His story is so courageous that more
        people should know about it.”<br/><br/>
        “Karl’s my angel,” says little Danny to his mother, when Malone visits him in the hospital. “He’s been a good
        friend. He’s helped brighten my days.”<br/><br/>
        After game six of the 1996 NBA Western Finals, Karl Malone gave little Danny the famous number-32 jersey he
        had worn during the game. Danny Ewing knew immediately what he wanted to do with the jersey. He asked his mother
        to bury him in it. She did, and Karl Malone was a pallbearer at the funeral.<br/><br/>
        In 1996 Karl was honored by the Make-A-Wish Foundation as their National Celebrity of the Year. In Utah, year
        after year, he is everybody’s Man of the Year. Thanks for every delivery. For young and old, male and female, sports

        daily practice - even when it’s a gruelling workout. Remember, happiness is
        not in the destination, it’s the journey. Having said this, let me say a few words
        about motivation.<br/><br/>
        I was asked to speak to a group of fathers and sons about setting goals. We were in an
        auditorium with no basketball standards around, so it was a perfect place to show the guys
        how important goals are.<br/><br/>
        One of the boys in the audience had a basketball with him so I had him come forward with it. I told him to dribble a
        few times and to shoot a basket. The boy followed my instructions, shaking his head. He shot.
        “Did you make it?” I asked.<br/><br/>
        “No,” he said grumpily. ‘There aren’t any baskets. There isn’t any thing to shoot for!”
        With that simple answer I had made the point I wanted to make. Nobody would want to play basketball without
        any hoops to shoot for. There would be no point to it, no way to keep score. And everybody wants to know if they have
        won or lost.<br/><br/>
        Life is the same way. You need goals if you want to score and feel good about life. Targets show us where we’ve
        been and where we still have to go. It’s always comforting to see the finish line so we know how far we have to run.<br/><br/>
        Remember, if you go through life without ambitions, you’ll never make the grade. There is only one way to really
        play the game - whether it’s basketball or the game of life.<br/><br/>
        Aim for something and shoot to score!`

        blatantly obvious in the National Football League.<br/><br/>
        Certain teams are perennial champions and others are perennial losers. Why?<br/><br/>
        The answer came when the players on the lastand first-place teams were interviewed, and
        asked “Why are you here?” The last-place players’ eyes were downcast. They mumbled
        excuses for their poor playing. They each answered the question, “I’m here to play
        football.” Observe the operative word I am.<br/><br/>
        Contrast these losers with the champions. When the powerhouse players were questioned, they stood taller, with
        confidence and enthusiasm oozing from every pore. They knew their purpose and they expected positive results.<br/><br/>
        When asked, “Why are you here?” they boldly proclaimed, “We’re here to win the Super Bowl!”<br/><br/>
        Can you see the difference?<br/><br/>
        In one instance the losers had no vision. They were content to be in a mediocre, shortterm survival mode, just
        hanging on to finish the season and pay the bills. In the other instance the winners had vision. They focused on
        purposes instead of just setting goals. They want it all, and are willing to work hard toward achieving that long-term,
        peak-performance result.<br/><br/>

        the leftovers. All of us need a long-term vision! What is yours?`

        in the Potomac River, a real-life hero emerged from obscurity.<br/><br/>
        flying too low, Air Florida’s Flight 90 had crashed into the 14th Street
        Bridge, catapulting plane, baggage and terrified passengers into the freezing water. A
        flight attendant was floating in the icy current doing every thing she could to stay alive.<br/><br/>
        Someone on shore threw her a rope, but she could not grab it. She went under and
        popped back up, waving her hands and screaming for help. For a second time she went
        under - this time for much longer. Wideeyed, scrambling and gasping for breath, she
        finally came up for one more attempt to save her life.<br/><br/>
        A shy, unassuming man named Vinnie Skutnick was standing on the bridge watching
        the tragedy. Believing that he could make a difference, he quickly removed his heavy
        overcoat, kicked off his boots and dove into the sub-freezing river. Swimming like an Olympian, Skutnick found the
        flight attendant, lifted her head and shoulders out of the water, and whispered, “You will live.” As he pulled her from
        the river, Skutnick was asked why he risked his life to save the stranger.<br/><br/>
        He replied, “I couldn’t save everybody, but I knew I could make a difference to one person.”<br/><br/>

        career homers.<br/><br/>
        Hank Aaron didn’t start at the top. In fact, he didn’t even play baseball in high school
        because his school didn’t have a team. Instead, he considered himself a bookworm. It wasn’t
        until he was in his early twenties that Aaron finally caught baseball fever and decided to
        pursue a professional career in sports.<br/><br/>
        At the time, there were few Blacks playing in major-league baseball. So he joined a semipro team called the
        Indianapolis Clowns of the Negro American League.<br/><br/>
        Henry played for $200 a month, waiting and praying for his first big break. Then a Milwaukee Braves scout
        spotted him and signed him to the “big time.” When Henry stepped to the batter’s box for the first time in his major
        league career, he was understandably nervous. There were two outs. The pressure was on. Thousands of eyes waited
        for him to perform. To cap it off, the opposing team catcher sneered at Henry as he came to the plate. As Henry held
        the bat with a cross-handed grip, the catcher sneered, “Hey, kid, you’re holding the bat wrong. You’re supposed to see
        the label of the bat.”<br/><br/>
        Henry turned and looked straight into the catcher’s eyes. “I didn’t come here to read,” he said, “I came here to
        hit.” With that, he drilled the next pitch into the outfield and laughed his way to first base.<br/><br/>
        Henry Aaron became one of baseball’s all-time greats. And from firsthand experience, he understands the saying,

        was 20 years old, Joe had served time in reform school, jail and even a padded cell for
        incorrigibles. He flunked out of school four times, went through nearly 30 jobs and was
        literally kicked out of the Marine Corps.<br/><br/>
        As a high school drop-out with no skills and no money, he tried his hand at professional boxing. He soon quit that

        One day, as he was passing Brooklyn’s Erasmus Hall High School, Joe saw a sign that invited passersby to enroll in
        night school. Suddenly, he realized that his only chance for a better life was through education.<br/><br/>
        Joe enrolled, found that he loved to learn and graduated with the highest grade point average in the history of
        Erasmus Hall’s night school. He then decided to attend the University of California at Santa Barbara, where he became
        president of the student body and graduated magna cum laude. After graduation, he began reviewing his life with all its
        defeats and decided there was one more thing he should do. He reenlisted in the marines to remove that embarrassing
        blemish from his record. After an honorable discharge, he entered Harvard Law School and graduated as class
        valedictorian in 1967.<br/><br/>
        His valedictory address touched everyone present, as he recounted his life story and concluded with these words:<br/><br/>
        “Do not look for tragedy or trauma to explain the change in me; it came mainly from inner resolution. Life is a
        story and as the author of my own never before written story, I had the right and the charge to write it and rewrite it so

        Nevertheless, he practiced faithfully.<br/><br/>
        When he arrived in Athens, he was pleasantly amazed to find that a discus weighed slightly more than five pounds.<br/><br/>
        As the event started, Garrett went up against the reigning Greek champion. He easily beat the favored contender and

        called Quarters for Shoes. During the holidays the station encourages people to
        donate quarters for gifts for those members of the community who could use a
        helping hand.<br/><br/>
        Here's a letter that it received:<br/><br/>
        Dear Channel Five,<br/><br/>
        We are Fred, age 15, Misty, age 12, and B.J., age 9.<br/><br/>
        Six years ago our father died suddenly. Five months later our mother abandoned us. We have lived with our
        granmother ever since. Two years ago grandma adopted us.<br/><br/>
        Because grandma is a widow and now a single parent, she needed help in keeping our home neat. We kids are
        really messy and didn't keep our things picked up. Grandma gave us an allowance, but we had to pay 25ȼ for each
        item we left laying around. This was okay, bur Grandma is a real softy, so she would put our quarters back into our
        banks, thinking we wouldn't know, but we did. So we remained messy.<br/><br/>
        Last year, we were watching your station and you were talking about kids who needed shoes and Quarters for
        Shoes. We decided we wanted to help. The quarters are for being messy and not feeling guilty about it. We like it
        because we are helping kids not as lucky as we are.<br/><br/>
        The handwritten letter, signed by Fred Misty and B. J., included $136. Those three kids might be guilty of having
        messy rooms, but their hearts are so clean.`

        who was recently converted.<br/><br/>
        “Do you know what I do with this raw iron?” asked the blacksmith. “I take a
        piece and heat it in the fire until it is red. Then I hammer it unmercifully into the shape I
        desire. When it is formed, I plunge it into a pail of cold water to temper it. Then I heat it
        again and hammer it some more. And this I do until it is finished.”<br/><br/>
        Before his friend, the nonbeliever, could reply, the blacksmith continued.<br/><br/>
        “But sometimes I find a piece of iron that won’t stand this treatment. The heat, the
        hammering and the cold water are too much and it breaks apart.” He pointed to a heap of
        scrap iron that was near the door of his shop.<br/><br/>
        “Those pieces will never be good for any thing.” The blacksmith went on. “Sometimes I have felt God’s hammer
        upon me. But I don’t mind, if only he can bring me to what I should be. And so in all these hard times, my prayer is
        simply this: Try me in any way you wish, Lord, only don’t throw me on the scrap heap.”`

        contentEn: `It is cold, so bitter cold, on this dark, winter day in 1942. But it is no different from
        any other day in this Nazi concentration camp. I stand shivering in my thin rags,
        still in disbelief that this nightmare is happening. I am just a young boy. I should
        be playing with friends; I should be going to school; I should be looking forward
        to a future, to growing up and marrying, and having a family of my own. But those
        dreams are for the living, and I am no longer one of them. Instead, I am almost dead,
        surviving from day to day, from hour to hour, ever since I was taken from my home
        and brought here with tens of thousands of other Jews. Will I still be alive tomorrow?
        Will I be taken to the gas chamber tonight?<br/><br/>
        Back and forth I walk next to the barbed wire fence, trying to keep my emaciated
        body warm. I am hungry. I am always hungry. Edible food seems like a dream. Each
        day, as more of us disappear, the happy past seems like a mere dream, and I sink
        deeper and deeper into despair.<br/><br/>
        Suddenly, I notice a young girl walking past on the other side of the barbed wire. She stops and looks at me with
        sad eyes, eyes that seem to say that she understands, that she, too, cannot fathom why I am here. I want to look away,
        oddly ashamed for this stranger to see me like this, but I cannot tear my eyes from hers.<br/><br/>
        Then she reaches into her pocket, and pulls out a red apple. A beautiful, shiny red apple. Oh, how long has it been
        since I have seen one! She looks cautiously to the left and to the right, and then with a smile of triumph, quickly throws
        the apple over the fence. I run to pick it up, holding it in my trembling, frozen fingers. In my world of death, this apple
        is an expression of life, of love. I glance up in time to see the girl disappearing into the distance.<br/><br/>
        The next day, I cannot help myself – I am drawn at the same time to that spot near the fence. Am I crazy for
        hoping she will come again? Of course. But in here, I cling to any tiny scrap of hope. She has given me hope and I must
        hold tightly to it.<br/><br/>
        And again, she comes. And again, she brings me an apple, flinging it over the fence with that same sweet smile.<br/><br/>
        This time I catch it, and hold it up for her to see. Her eyes twinkle. Does she pity me? Perhaps. I do not care,
        though. I am just so happy to gaze at her. And for the first time in so long, I feel my heart move with emotion.<br/><br/>
        For seven months, we meet like this. Sometimes we exchange a few words. Sometimes, just an apple. But she is
        feeding more than my belly, this angel from heaven. She is feeding my soul. And somehow, I know I am feeding hers as
        well.<br/><br/>
        One day, I hear frightening news: we are being shipped to another camp. This could mean the end for me. And it
        definitely means the end for me and my friend.<br/><br/>
        The next day when I greet her, my heart is breaking, and I can barely speak as I say what must be said: “Do not
        bring me an apple tomorrow,” I tell her. “I am being sent to another camp. We will never see each other again.”<br/><br/>
        Turning before I lose all control, I run away from the fence. I cannot bear to look back. If I did, I know she would see
        my tears streaming down my face.<br/><br/>
        Months pass and the nightmare continues. But the memory of this girl sustains me through the terror, the pain,
        the hopelessness. Over and over in my mind, I see her face, her kind eyes, I hear her gentle words, I taste those apples.<br/><br/>
        And then one day, just like that, the nightmare is over. The war has ended. Those of us who are still alive are freed.<br/><br/>
        I have lost every thing that was precious to me, including my family. But I still have the memory of this girl, a memory
        I carry in my heart and gives me the will to go on as I move to America to start a new life.<br/><br/>
        years pass. It is 1957. I am living in New Y ork City. A friend convinces me to go on a blind date with a lady friend
        of his. Reluctantly, I agree. But she is nice, this woman named Roma. And like me, she is an immigrant, so we have at
        least that in common.<br/><br/>
        “Where were you during the war?” Roma asks me gently, in that delicate way immigrants ask one another
        questions about those years.<br/><br/>
        “I was in a concentration camp in Germany,” I reply.<br/><br/>
        Roma gets a far away look in her eyes, as if she is remembering something painful yet sweet.<br/><br/>
        “What is it?” I ask.<br/><br/>
        “I am just thinking about something from my past, Herman,” Roma explains in a voice suddenly very soft. “You
        see, when I was a young girl, I lived near a concentration camp. There was a boy there, a prisoner, and for a long while,
        I used to visit him everyday. I remember I used to bring him apples. I would throw the apple over the fence, and he
        would be so happy.”<br/><br/>
        Roma sighs heavily and continues. “It is hard to describe how we felt about each other – after all, we were young,
        and we only exchanged a few words when we could – but I can tell you, there was much love there. I assume he was
        killed like so many others. But I cannot bear to think that, and so I try to remember him as he was for those months we
        were given together.”<br/><br/>
        With my heart pounding so loudly I think it will explode, I look directly at Roma and ask, “And did that boy say to
        you one day, ‘Do not bring me an apple tomorrow. I am being sent to another camp’?”<br/><br/>
        “Why, yes,” Roma responds, her voice trembling. “But, Herman, how on earth could you possibly know that?”<br/><br/>
        I take her hands in mine and answer, “Because I was that young boy, Roma.”<br/><br/>
        For many moments, there is only silence. We cannot take our eyes from each other, and as the veils of time lift, we
        recognize the dear friend we once loved so much, whom we have never stopped loving, whom we have never stopped
        remembering.<br/><br/>
        Finally, I speak: “Roma, I was separated from you once, and I don’t ever want to be separated from you again.<br/><br/>
        Now, I am free, and I want to be together with you forever. Dear, will you marry me?”<br/><br/>
        I see that same twinkle in her eye as Roma says, “Yes, I will marry you,” and we embrace, the embrace we longed
        to share for so many months, but barbed wire came between us. Now, nothing ever will again.<br/><br/>
        Almost forty years have passed since that day when I found my Roma again. Destiny brought us together the first
        time during the war to show me a promise of hope, and now it had reunited us to fulfill that promise.<br/><br/>
        Valentine’s Day, 1996. I bring Roma to the Oprah Winfrey Show to honor her on national television. I want to tell
        her in front of millions of people what I feel in my heart everyday:<br/><br/>
        “Darling, you fed me in the concentration camp when I was hungry. And I am still hungry, for something I will
        never get enough of: I am only hungry for your love.”

        worth while`,
        author: `George Target`,
        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `Let’s call him Ian. That’s not his real name – but in Northern Ireland
        these days you have to be careful about revealing names. There have
        been more than twenty-four hundred sectarian murders since the
        recent flare-up of ancient troubles between Catholics and
        Protestants. So there’s no sense taking risks.<br/><br/>
        And Ian has had misery enough for his twenty-four years of life.<br/><br/>
        He came from good Protestant stock, the sort that goes to church twice
        every Sunday as regular as clock. His father, a welder in the Belfast
        shipyards, was very steady. Mother kept a clean and tidy house, baked the
        best bread in the neighborhood and ruled the family with the sharp edge of
        her tongue. Two elder brothers, both unemployed laborers.<br/><br/>
        Ian did well at school and was now earning good money as a craftsman
        in a production plant. Quiet, serious, fond of walking through the
        country side, he liked few things better than a book by the roaring fire during the long loneliness of winter. Never had
        much to do with girlfriends – though men tend to marry late in Ireland.<br/><br/>
        Two years ago, on his twenty-second birthday, he was walking home from work when a terrorist hurled a bomb
        from a speeding car... and left Ian in the nightmare of sudden blindness.<br/><br/>
        He was rushed to a hospital, operated on immediately for internal injuries and broken bones. But both eyes were
        destroyed.<br/><br/>
        The other wounds healed in their own time, though their scars would disfigure his flesh the rest of his days. But the
        scars on his mind, though invisible, were even more obvious.<br/><br/>
        He hardly spoke a word, hardly ate or drank, hardly slept. He simply lay in bed, brooding and sighing. Nearly four
        months.<br/><br/>
        There was one nurse who seemed to be able to draw some small spark of human response from him. Let’s call her
        Bridget – a fine Irish name. Good Catholic stock, the sort that goes to Mass first thing every Sunday morning.<br/><br/>
        Her father, a carpenter, mostly worked away from home over in England. A decent man – loved his family, spent
        weekends with them whenever he could afford the fare.<br/><br/>
        Mother kept a clean but untidy house, cooked the best stew in the neighborhood and ruled the family with a quick
        hand and a soft heart.<br/><br/>
        Six brothers, four sisters - with the youngest of them all, Mary, eleven, her father’s darling.<br/><br/>
        Bridget did well at school, had trained as a nurse at a famous London hospital, and now, at the age of twenty-one,
        was a staff nurse in Belfast’s biggest hospital.<br/><br/>
        Lively, though fundamentally serious, a singer with a sweet and gentle voice and a way of her own with folk songs.<br/><br/>
        Never had much to do with boy friends - though it wasn’t from any lack of young men who’d set their caps at her.<br/><br/>
        But now her heart was moved by Ian, for there was something about him that brought tears to her eyes. True, he
        couldn’t see the tears, yet she was afraid that her voice would betray her emotions.<br/><br/>
        But in a way she was right about her voice, because it was the lilt and the laughter of it that dragged him back from
        the depths of depression and self-pity.<br/><br/>
        And so, as the long dark of his days turned to weeks and months, he would listen for her footsteps and turn his
        sightless face toward her coming like a flower bending for the sun.<br/><br/>
        At the end of his four months in the hospital he was pronounced incurably blind, but what he now knew as their
        love gave him the courage to accept his affliction. Because, despite every thing against them - religion, politics, the
        opposition of their families - they were in love and wandering in that young and singing landscape.<br/><br/>
        He was discharged and began the weary months: how to wash and shave and dress without help, how to move
        around the house without cracking his shins on every chair, how to walk through the streets with a white stick, how to
        read Braille, how to survive the pity he could sense in the very air he breathed. Their love gave him the hope to go on
        living and trying.<br/><br/>
        Not that they were able to spend much of their lives together: an occasional evening, perhaps an afternoon when
        her duties allowed. But they lived for those brief encounters and knew the beginnings of deep peace and joys.<br/><br/>
        Knowing their story, the families were appalled. Thinking of getting married? The very law of God forbade it,
        surely.<br/><br/>
        “What fellowship hath the children of light with the children of darkness?” thundered his father. “You’ll not be
        marrying her whilst I’m drawing breath!”<br/><br/>
        “The Roman Catholic Church,” stated her priest, “discourages mixed marriages, so you can be putting the idea
        from you!”<br/><br/>
        So, by all manner of pressures – constant arguments, threats, promises and even downright lies – they were
        driven apart. And, eventually, they quarreled, said hurtful things in their black misery, and one evening, with the rain
        drizzling, she walked away from him on the weeping street.<br/><br/>
        He withdrew into his perpetual night. Days and weeks of bitterness. “You’ll not be regretting it in the long run,” he
        was told. “You’d have been inviting trouble by yoking with an unbeliever!”<br/><br/>
        She withdrew into her work, too sick at heart to remember. Weeks and months of numbed agony. “You’ll live to
        praise the Almighty,” she was told. “You’d have been asking for hell on earth marrying a Protestant!”
        The months drained into a year. And the bombings continued, to the grief of Ireland.<br/><br/>
        Then one evening, as Ian sat alone in the house, there came a frantic hammering at the door. “Ian, come you
        quick!”<br/><br/>
        By the voice, hy sterical, choked, with tears, he recognized young Mary, Bridget’s sister. “A bombing! She’s
        trapped and half-dead, so she is! Screaming your name. Come you, Ian! In the name of God, please come!”<br/><br/>
        Without even shutting the door behind him, he took her hand. And she led and stumbled and cried with him
        through the merciless streets.<br/><br/>
        The bomb had devastated a little restaurant where Bridget had been eating supper with three other nurses. The
        others had managed to scramble out from under the shifting rubble. But she was trapped by the legs. And the fire was
        spreading, licking towards her.<br/><br/>
        They could hear her screaming, but couldn’t yet reach the pit where she lay. Firemen, soldiers, lights and special
        equipment were on the way.<br/><br/>
        Ian moved into the chaos. “You can’t go in there!” shouted the officer.<br/><br/>
        “She’s my girl,” said Ian.<br/><br/>
        “Don’t be a raving lunatic!” shouted the officer again. “You’ll not be seeing your hand in front of your face in the
        darkness!”<br/><br/>
        “What difference does darkness make to a blind man?” asked Ian.<br/><br/>
        And he turned toward the sound of her voice, and moved through that black inferno with all the skills and
        instincts of the blind, all the urgency of love. “I’m coming, Bridget! I’m coming!”<br/><br/>
        And he found her and cradled her head in his yearning arms, and kissed her.<br/><br/>
        “Ian,” she whispered, “Ian...” and lapsed into unconsciousness like a tired child.<br/><br/>
        And with her blood soaking into his clothes, the fire reaching them, he held her until their rescuers chopped a way
        through. What he didn’t see, being blind, was that the side of her lovely face had been seared by fire.<br/><br/>
        In time, a long time, she recovered. Despite cosmetic surgery, though, her face would always be scarred. “But,”
        she said, “the only man I love will never have the seeing of it, so what difference does it make to me?” And they took up
        their love from where they had never really left it.<br/><br/>
        True, both families fought it every step of the way. One dramatic confrontation almost led to a fistfight: shouted
        abuse, insults, desperate threats. But, in the middle of it, Bridget took Ian’s hand, and together they walked out of that
        place of hatred.`,

        mine twenty years ago. In the years that followed, I often stopped in
        his little Colorado town to see him when I went west, and sometimes
        he would tell me stories about people we both had known. He told me
        about John and Louise.<br/><br/>
        John was a ranchman, big, quiet, unlettered and strong as a horse. He
        had begun with fifty head of sheep. Ambitious and frugal, in ten years he
        owned two thousand ewes and ample pasture for them. Next, he bought an
        alfalfa farm at the edge of town and fattened his lambs. By the time he was
        forty-five he was a prosperous man.<br/><br/>
        Then he married. Louise was a local girl who had finished high school
        and gone to work as a waitress in the restaurant in town. John met her
        there the summer she was twenty. Soon he began driving in from his alfalfa
        farm everyday for a ten o’clock cup of coffee.<br/><br/>
        Louise chattered to him about the weather, the crops and harmless local gossip. John merely watched her and
        smiled and nodded his head.<br/><br/>
        This went on for three months. Then one morning – Doc Case had stopped in for coffee and heard it – John said,
        “Louise, I want you to marry me.” Louise caught her breath and almost spilled the coffee. Doc said it was as though the
        two of them, John and Louise, were all alone. Louise said, “John, maybe I will. But I want a day or two to think about
        it.” John nodded and drank his coffee and said, “Got to get to work. So long.”<br/><br/>
        They were married two weeks later. After a honeymoon in Colorado Springs they settled down on the alfalfa farm,
        and Louise had the house painted and papered and refurnished with things from Denver. All that first year John had
        workmen out there, putting in a new kitchen, building a screened porch.<br/><br/>
        But Doc Case knew things weren’t going right. Twice John called him out to see Louise, and he discovered that
        Louise wasn’t happy. She wasn’t well, either; she said she had frightful headaches, but there was nothing that Doc could
        put his finger on. The second time he went out to see her he asked her if John was treating her right. Louise answered
        that John was the best husband any woman could ask for, only he didn’t say much, and a woman wants to be talked to.<br/><br/>
        After that things seemed to straighten out. When Doc saw her in town a few weeks later, Louise said, “I guess I was just
        imagining a lot of aches and pains. I’ve decided to be big and strong, like John!”<br/><br/>
        It was not until eighteen months later that Doc heard from them again. At 3:30 one morning, a banging on his
        door wakened him. John was there, his car out front with the motor running. “Doc,” he said, “Louise is awful sick. You
        got to do something quick!” Louise was in the car, almost fainting with pain. They had been out at John’s sheep ranch
        for a few days and the pain had struck her late that evening. She tried to shrug it off, but it got so bad she couldn’t stand
        it. She fainted on the thirty-mile drive to town.<br/><br/>
        The doctor took her over to his four-bed hospital and operated. Her appendix had burst, but she rallied by dawn
        and Doc Case thought he had won. He told John they wouldn’t know for twenty-four hours, but it looked as if the worst
        was over. John cried like a baby. “She’s got to get well, Doc,” he said. “She’s got to!”<br/><br/>
        By evening her condition was worse. Doc gave her two plasma transfusions during the night, yet she weakened
        steadily. “I’m just not strong enough,” she whispered to the doctor.<br/><br/>
        “What do you mean?” Doc demanded. “I thought you were going to be big and strong like John.”<br/><br/>
        Louise smiled wanly. “John is so strong that he doesn’t need me. If he did he’d sayso, wouldn’t he?”<br/><br/>
        “Louise,” Doc told her, “John does need you, whether he says so or not.”<br/><br/>
        She shook her head and closed her eyes.<br/><br/>
        In the office, Doc said to John, “She doesn’t want to get well.”<br/><br/>
        “She’s got to get well!” John exclaimed. “Look, Doc, how about a transfusion?”<br/><br/>
        The doctor explained that he had given her plasma.<br/><br/>
        “I mean my blood, Doc. I’m strong enough for both of us!”<br/><br/>
        The doctor led him down the hall. “Do you love that girl, John?” he asked.<br/><br/>
        “Wouldn’t have married her if I didn’t,” John said.<br/><br/>
        “Have you ever told her so?”<br/><br/>
        John’s eyes were baffled. “Haven’t I given her every thing I could? What more can a man do?”<br/><br/>
        “Talk to her,” Doc said.<br/><br/>
        “I’m not a talking man, Doc. Hell, she knows that!” He gripped Doc’s shoulders. “Give her some of my blood!”<br/><br/>
        The doctor thought a moment. Then he led John to the little laboratory, took a blood sample and typed it. At last
        he said, “All right, John. In ten minutes.”<br/><br/>
        The doctor went to Louise’s room and told her that John wanted to give her a transfusion. He took her pulse. It
        was weak and fluttering slightly. He knew there was only a slim chance. Calling the nurse into the hall, he told her what
        he was going to do.<br/><br/>
        In a few moments he led John into Louise’s room. The operating table had been placed beside her bed, and a
        curtain rigged up between bed and table. The nurse held the curtain aside as John lay down on the table. He put out a
        big, awkward hand and took Louise’s hand and said, “Now I’m going to make you well, Louise.”<br/><br/>
        Without looking at him, she whispered, “Why?”<br/><br/>
        “Why do you suppose?” John exclaimed.<br/><br/>
        “I don’t know,” she said.<br/><br/>
        “You’re my wife, ain’t you?”<br/><br/>
        There was no answer. The nurse lowered the curtain, swabbed John’s arm and inserted a needle. John flexed the
        muscle proudly. “Here it comes,” he said to Louise. A moment later he asked, “How’s she taking it, Doc?”<br/><br/>
        Beyond the curtain, Doc Case had inserted a needle in Louise’s wrist and relaxed the clamp on the tube. His fingers
        were on the pulse in her other wrist.<br/><br/>
        “Okay, John,” he said.<br/><br/>
        “How does it feel, Louise?” John asked.<br/><br/>
        “All right,” she whispered.<br/><br/>
        “Get this blood in you,” John said, “and you’ll talk as loud as I do.”<br/><br/>
        Her pulse seemed to strengthen slightly.<br/><br/>
        “John,” she whispered.<br/><br/>
        “Yes?”<br/><br/>
        “I love you, John.”<br/><br/>
        There was a moment of silence. Then John said, “Louise! You got to get well!”<br/><br/>
        “Why?” she whispered.<br/><br/>
        “You’ve got to do it for me. I need you.” John hesitated, and his voice choked. “I love you.”<br/><br/>
        Her pulse almost surged.<br/><br/>
        “You never told me,” she said.<br/><br/>
        He said, “I never thought I had to.”<br/><br/>
        The pulse was steady now.<br/><br/>
        “John,” she said, “tell me again.”<br/><br/>
        He hesitated, then repeated the words: “I love you, Louise. More than any thing in the world. I love you and I need
        you, and by God, I’m going to make you well!”<br/><br/>
        The doctor removed the needle from her wrist and took the plasma bottle from the rack and set them aside. He
        checked her pulse again. It was impossible, but there it was - steady and strong.<br/><br/>
        “How are you doing over there?” John asked, his voice under control again. But Louise couldn’t answer. She was
        weeping.<br/><br/>
        “She’s coming along fine,” Doc Case said. “You’ve done it, John!” He signaled to the nurse, who pulled the needle
        from John’s arm, removed the jar from beside the operating table and drew the curtain aside. Then she and the doctor
        went out.<br/><br/>
        When the doctor returned several minutes later, John was sitting with both of Louise’s hands in his, talking to her.
        “She was still a mighty sick girl,” Doc said to me, “but I knew she was going to get well. And she did.”<br/><br/>
        Doc shook his head. “It was enough that the miracle happened. John’s blood was the wrong type for her, probably
        would have killed her. What did it matter if she got another pint of plasma while his blood went into a glass jar? What
        that girl needed was John. And she got him.”`,

        contentEn: `I just spent four days with a girlfriend who is married to a very wealthy man.
        He gave her a $35,000 ruby ring as an engagement present. He gave her a
        $25,000 emerald necklace for Mother’s Day. He gave her $250,000 to
        redecorate their enormous home on five acres of land. Her bathroom cost
        $120,000 to build. Even her dog eats from a silver-plated dish engraved with his
        name.<br/><br/>
        Her husband has taken her all over the world - Tahiti for sun, Paris for
        clothes, London for the theater, Australia for adventure. There is nowhere she
        cannot go, nothing she cannot buy, nothing she cannot have - except for one
        thing: He does not love her the way she wants to be loved.<br/><br/>
        We sat in her study late last night, my friend and I, talking as only women
        who have known each other since they were just girls can talk. We talked about
        our bodies, changing with each passing year, hers now rounded with the new life
        she was carrying inside. We talked about what we used to believe in and our search for new meaning. And we talked
        about our men - her wealthy, successful financier, my hardworking, struggling artist.<br/><br/>
        “Are you happy?” I asked her. She sat quietly for a moment, toying with the three-carat diamond wedding ring on
        her finger. Then, slowly, almost in a whisper, she began to explain. She appreciated all of her wealth, but she would
        trade it in a minute for a certain quality of love she didn’t feel with her husband. She loved him intellectually more than
        she felt her love for him. She did not respect many of his values in life, and this turned her off to him sexually.<br/><br/>
        Although he was fully committed to her, and took care of her, he did not give her the experience of being loved from
        moment to moment - the affection, the tenderness, the words lovers use, the listening, the sensitivity, the nurturing,
        the respect, the willingness to participate with her in creating the relationship each day.<br/><br/>
        As I listened to my friend, I came to realize more than ever before that the love of my true companion makes me
        rich beyond any thing material a man could ever give to me. This was not the first time I have deeply felt this, but once
        again, it was a reminder of my great good fortune.<br/><br/>
        And I thought about the drawerful of cards and love notes written by him, and the three latest delightful additions
        in my purse. I thought about him touching me, grasping my hand protectively as we cross the street, stroking my hair
        as I lie in his lap. I thought about our trust, and our respect, and our hunger for life and learning.<br/><br/>
        And in that moment, I saw that my friend envied me and my relationship. She, who sat in her luxurious home,
        wrapped in jewels and splendor, envied our vitality, our play fulness, our passion, our commitment - yes, our
        commitment.<br/><br/>
        For in that moment, I saw that what we have that is greater than any thing else between us is commitment: to
        loving one another fully, completely and deeply.<br/><br/>
        It is not a commitment that has been declared to others, or perhaps, even out loud between ourselves.<br/><br/>
        It is not symbolized by a band of gold or even a diamond.<br/><br/>
        It is not defined by time, or even the space in which we live apart or together.<br/><br/>
        Rather, it is a living commitment, reaffirmed each time we reach out to one another in pure joy, each time we tell
        the truth, each time one of us is there to support or comfort the other, each time we share a newly uncovered insight
        or emotion.<br/><br/>
        Today, when I arrived home, I found a large check waiting for me on the table, money I hadn’t expected. And I
        laughed at the meaningless numbers all lined up in a row.<br/><br/>
        For last night, after talking with my friend, I learned the difference between having money and truly being
        wealthy. And I knew that I was already the richest woman in the world.

        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `It was right before Christmas. My husband, Dan, and a buddy of his,
        Mike, had gone to a canyon near our home in Southern California to
        see if the vegetation, scorched by fires a few months earlier, was
        growing back. Dan and Mike were both members of the California
        Native Plant Society. They were real “plant hounds,” always exploring the
        nearby canyons and hills to see what kind of plants they could find and
        photograph.<br/><br/>
        That day, after Mike left, Dan decided to do a little “solo research” by
        hiking up into Laguna Canyon, a more remote section of the area that was
        not often explored. He had walked into the canyon a few miles, gotten
        some pictures and was starting to make his way back to his truck, when he
        stepped on a water-soaked patch of ground that gave way. He fell thirty-
        five feet down the rough slope, hitting a number of trees, before he landed
        on a ledge. He could tell right away that something was terribly wrong
        with his left leg. It lied across his other leg at an “impossible angle.”<br/><br/>
        Stunned by the fall, it took Dan a little while to realize that he was too crippled to walk. Then Dan knew he was in
        serious trouble. Night would fall soon and not a soul knew where he was. He had to get to a main trail or he might die
        out there before anyone could find him. He braced the broken leg against the other leg and, resting his weight on his
        hands, began inching his way down the canyon.<br/><br/>
        Making slow and painful progress, Dan stopped often to rest and call for help. The only response was the eerie
        sound of his own voice echoing off the walls of the canyon. As the sun set, the temperature began to drop. It was cold
        in the hills at night and Dan knew that if he stopped for too long, he would probably lose consciousness. It was
        increasingly hard, but Dan forced himself after each pause to keep hauling his sore body forward on his aching hands.<br/><br/>
        He continued this awful journey for another twelve hours.<br/><br/>
        Finally, his strength and determination gave out. He was utterly exhausted and couldn’t move another inch.<br/><br/>
        Although it seemed futile, he summoned up a last burst of strength and shouted for help.<br/><br/>
        He was astounded when he heard a voice return his call. A real voice, not another echo. It was Dan’s stepson – my
        son, Jeb. He and I were out with the police and the paramedics who were searching for Dan.<br/><br/>
        Earlier, when Dan didn’t come home, I had gotten worried and called Mike. At first, Mike tried to find Dan himself,
        driving from canyon to canyon looking for Dan’s truck. Finally, he called the police and reported Dan missing.<br/><br/>
        I’d kept calm and strong until the moment Jeb said he’d heard Dan’s voice. Then I dissolved into tears, finally
        feeling the fear and dread I’d been pushing aside for hours. It took over two hours for the rescue team to bring Daniel
        down the ravine. Then the paramedics trundled him away on a stretcher and when I got to see him at the hospital, my
        tears started anew. The thought of how close I came to losing this wonderful man undid me. It was only when I felt
        Dan’s arms around me that I finally stopped sobbing.<br/><br/>
        As I sat next to his hospital bed, my eyes fastened to the face I had been so afraid I would never see again, Dan
        told me his story. Immediately after his slide down the canyon, when he realized the seriousness of his predicament,
        Dan said that he thought of me and how much he would miss me if he didn’t make it back. As he lay at the bottom of the
        rough cliff, he groped around until he found a suitable rock. Using the rock, which was sharply pointed, he managed to
        carve a message to me in a large rock near where he lay. If the worst should happen, he hoped I would eventually see
        the rock and know that I had been with him alway s, held close in his heart.<br/><br/>
        I started weeping all over again. I knew how deeply I loved my husband, but I was unprepared for this, the depth
        of his love for me.<br/><br/>
        For somewhere deep in the wooded hills of Laguna Canyon, there is a large rock with a heart carved on its side.
        And in this heart are carved the words: Elizabeth, I love you.`,

        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `In wedding portraits on the walls of their Las Vegas, New Mexico, living room, Kim
        and Krickitt Carpenter look like any young newlyweds – deeply in love and filled
        with hope for their new life together. But Krickitt admits it causes her some pain
        now to look at the pictures or to see herself in the wedding video in her lacy white
        gown. “I would almost rather not watch it,” she says. “It makes me miss the girl in the
        picture more and more.”<br/><br/>
        In a sense, that Krickitt is gone, lost forever. Less than ten weeks after the
        September 1993 ceremony, the Carpenters were in a nightmarish auto accident that
        badly injured them both and left Krickitt comatose. Though doctors initially doubted
        she would survive, she rallied, regaining consciousness and, eventually, most of her
        phy sical abilities. But the trauma to her brain caused amnesia, erasing virtually her
        entire memory of the previous eighteen months - including any recollection of the
        man she had fallen in love with and married. “The last two years have been based on a
        story I’m told,” says Krickitt, “because I don’t remember any of it.”<br/><br/>
        Krickitt Pappas was a sales representative for an Anaheim, California, sportswear company when Kim, then
        baseball coach and assistant athletic director at New Mexico Highlands University in Las Vegas, phoned in September
        1992 to order some team jackets. While chatting, they discovered mutual interests – both were devout Christians, and
        Krickitt’s father had also coached baseball. One call led to another, and by January, Kim, now thirty, recalls, “we were
        probably talking five hours a week.” The following April, he invited her to visit New Mexico for a weekend. “She got off
        the plane – I’ll never forget,” he says. “It was like I’d always known her.” Over the next few months, they spent nearly
        every weekend together. In June, he showed up unannounced at her apartment with flowers and a ring. “I asked if
        she’d become my lifetime buddy,” he says.<br/><br/>
        They seemed a good fit. Kim, who had played college baseball and golf at Highlands, was one of three sons of
        Danny Carpenter, a retired printing firm owner, and his wife Maureen. Krickitt (born Kristian) was a two-time
        Academic All American gymnast at Cal State, Fullerton. She grew up in Phoenix, the daughter of Gus and Mary Pappas,
        former school-teachers and coaches who also have a son, Jamey. Krickitt and Kim married that fall and moved into an
        apartment in Las Vegas (128 miles northeast of Albuquerque), where Krickitt found work as a hospital fitness
        instructor.<br/><br/>
        They were just settling into married life when, on November 24, they set out to visit her parents in Phoenix.<br/><br/>
        Krickitt - with Kimlying in the backseat and a friend in the passenger seat - was driving west on Interstate 40 and had
        to swerve to avoid hitting a slowmoving truck. A pickup following them smashed into the Carpenters’ car. Their Ford
        Escort flipped over on its roof and went into a sickening skid. “I can remember every split second of that wreck,” says
        Kim. “I screamed and screamed and screamed for Krickitt and got no answer.” Kim suffered a punctured lung, a bruise
        on his heart, a concussion and a broken hand. Milan Rasic, the friend, had a separated shoulder. But worst off was
        Krickitt, who had suffered a terrible skull fracture when the roof of the car caved in around her head. Unconscious and
        fastened by a seat belt, she hung upside down for thirty minutes before rescuers arrived, then forty more minutes
        before they could free her. Emergency medic D. J. Combs recalls that her pupils were fixed in a rightward gaze: “She
        had what we call ‘doll’s eyes.’”<br/><br/>
        “It was pretty bleak initially,” says emergency -room doctor Alan Beamsley, who was at the Gallup, New Mexico,
        hospital where Krickitt arrived nearly ninety minutes after the accident. “We were scared for her.” A doctor brought
        Kim an envelope containing Krickitt’s rings and watch. “He said, ‘I’m very sorry, Mr. Carpenter,’” Kim recalls. “I
        thought she’d died.” Despite doctors’ advice, he refused treatment for himself to stay by his wife’s side. “I didn’t
        recognize her, she was so messed up,” he says. “I grabbed her hand and said, ‘We’re gonna get through this.’”
        When a helicopter arrived to take Krickitt the 140 miles to the University of New Mexico hospital in Albuquerque,
        there was no room for Kim. Emergency medic Combs remembers his plea: “If my wife’s going to die, I want to be
        there.” By the time Kim reached Albuquerque five hours later, Krickitt was in a coma. The next morning, Thanksgiving,
        her parents flew in from Phoenix. Though doctors held out little hope, Kim recalls, “we went to the chapel and started
        praying.” That day, the swelling started to subside and her dangerously low blood pressure slowly began to rise. In five
        days, she went off life support and ten days after the accident, emerging from her coma, she was transferred to
        Phoenix’s Barrow Neurological Institute.<br/><br/>
        Three weeks after the accident, when a nurse asked her what year it was, Krickitt responded: “1969.” She was able
        to name her parents. But when the nurse asked, “Who’s your husband?” she replied, “I’m not married.” Tests soon
        showed that she had maintained most of her long-term memory. As for her husband, he was a complete stranger - she
        felt nothing for him. “I don’t have a visual memory in my head, and I have no memory in my heart,” she says now.<br/><br/>
        Kim remembers comforting himself by saying, “This isn’t my wife; my wife is in this body, trapped and trying to
        get out.” He worked to encourage her rehabilitation. But Krickitt found his presence and pep talks annoying. “I think
        she resented his pushing because at that point she wasn’t Krickitt,” says her mother, Mary, adding that the process of
        reteaching her daughter the most basic tasks “was like raising her again.” Facing medical bills in excess of two hundred
        thousand dollars and relentless bill collectors, Kim returned to his Las Vegas job with serious doubts about the future.<br/><br/>
        “I honestly didn’t think our marriage would work,” says Kim, but he wouldn’t give up. “I made a vow before God,” he
        explains, “‘until death do you part.’”<br/><br/>
        Then Krickitt began to travel with her mother to visit Kim, then returned on her own to see him again. “I figured, if
        I fell in love with this guy before, I guess I just need to meet him again,” says Krickitt. Almost five months after the
        crash, she moved back in with him, but their life together was difficult. Her injuries had caused deep emotional swings
        and left her quicktempered. And she was baffled by her reentry into marriage. “I remember asking, ‘How did I do the
        wife thing? Did I cook for you? Did I bring you lunch?’” Her neurological problems posed other difficulties. She was
        unable to drive and couldn’t remember directions. She tired easily, and her emotions were jumbled - she would laugh
        when she meant to cry and cry when she meant to laugh. Says Kim: “I was thinking, ‘Man, I’m living with someone with
        two different personalities.’”<br/><br/>
        She has slowly regained control of her life, returning to work in August 1994, but a new personality emerged - a
        blend of her old self with new, more outgoing traits. (She is likely to have chronic lingering effects, including shortterm
        memory lapses and occasional clumsiness.) And it was difficult to make the marriage work again. Mike Hill, a therapist
        the couple started seeing in fall 1994, pinpointed the problem, saying, “There wasn’t that emotional attachment that
        comes through the early part of the relationship. You need to establish some memories of your own.” So Kim and
        Krickitt began dating again - chatting over pizza, shopping, jet skiing at a nearby lake. “I got to know my husband
        again,” says Krickitt. “There was a point when I really started to enjoy this companion. I would miss him if he wasn’t
        around.”<br/><br/>
        This year on Valentine’s Day, Kim proposed again. Krickitt accepted. “I could’ve not fallen in love with him again,
        but the Lord didn’t allow that,” she says. On May 25, the two again exchanged rings - new ones - and read newly written
        vows. “Only one thing can surpass forever the painful events we have felt,” Kim told her. “That is the love I have for
        you.”`,

        Within the hour, they ’d be leaving home and family to live in some
        godforsaken place called Levittown, New York.<br/><br/>
        Was it only a month ago that Johnny burst into the apartment with his great
        news... the job offer, the chance to get out of Milford and into something he really
        wanted? How could she tell him she could not leave her family – her home – her
        life?<br/><br/>
        They - the blond, blue-eyed cheerleader and the handsome football player, had been sweethearts all through high
        school: elected homecoming royalty their senior year and labeled in the yearbook as Milford High School’s Cutest
        Couple.<br/><br/>
        It was the fifties, and life was sweet in small-town America. Elvis Presley was king, and his hit, “Love Me Tender,”
        had just hit the airwaves. At the senior prom, Milford’s cutest couple slow danced, lost in each other’s arms as the band
        played “their song.” Johnny’s soft voice crooned the ly rics in her ear, and Libby’s heart melted.<br/><br/>
        “Be careful,” her mother warned. “You know what happens to girls who don’t behave themselves.”<br/><br/>
        Libby had no intention of being one of the girls talked about in the locker rooms. They would wait.<br/><br/>
        But on graduation night, without a word to anyone, they ran across the state line and stood before a justice of the
        peace. They could wait no longer.<br/><br/>
        On the arm of her new husband, Libby proudly displayed her wedding ring to dismayed parents who saw their
        dreams - the football scholarship, the college diploma, the long, white dress and veil, vanish like bubbles in the air.<br/><br/>
        “Are you pregnant?” her mother asked when she got Libby off to one side.<br/><br/>
        “No,” Libby assured her, hurt at the suggestion.<br/><br/>
        It was fun at first, playing house in the tiny apartment where they never seemed to get enough of each other.<br/><br/>
        Johnny worked full-time as a mechanic at Buckner’s garage and attended vo-tech at night, training to be an electrician.<br/><br/>
        Libby waited tables at the local diner. The newness soon wore off, and as they stumbled over each other in the close
        confines of two rooms, they dreamed and saved for a house of their own.<br/><br/>
        Now, a year later, Libby was five months pregnant, sick everyday and had to give up her job. High school friends
        quit calling the couple, who no longer had money for dancing and movies. Frequent arguments replaced words of love,
        as hopes and plans for the future dissolved into the empty frustration of barely getting by. Libby spent her days, and
        lately her nights, alone in the tiny apartment, suspecting that Johnny might be “fooling around.” Nobody works every
        night.<br/><br/>
        As she returned from another bout of morning sickness, Libby glanced in the mirror at the swollen body and
        unkempt hair.<br/><br/>
        Who could blame Johnny for looking around? What is there for him here? A baby coming, a fat,
        ugly wife and never any money.<br/><br/>
        Her mother fussed about the pale face and circles under her eyes. “You must take care of yourself, Libby,” her
        mother told her. “Think of your husband, think of the baby.”<br/><br/>
        That’s all Libby did think about - the baby... that impersonal lump inside, ruining her figure and making her
        constantly sick.<br/><br/>
        Then came the day Johnny told her about the new job in Levittown.<br/><br/>
        “We’ll be moving into a company house,” he said, his eyes shining. “It’s small, but it’s better than this dump.”<br/><br/>
        She nodded and blinked rapidly so he wouldn’t see the tears. She couldn’t leave Milford.<br/><br/>
        No one would be coming to say good-by e today.... It had been done last night at the farewell party. As Johnny
        hauled out the last box, she took a final walk through their first home, her footsteps echoing on bare wooden floors.<br/><br/>
        The odor of furniture polish and wax still hung in the air. Faint voices filled the rooms as she remembered the night
        they waxed those floors, giggling and pushing each other, pausing in the middle to love each other. Two cluttered
        rooms, now cold and empty. Funny how quickly they became impersonal cubes as though no one had ever lived, or
        loved, there. She closed the door behind her for the last time and hurried out to the truck.<br/><br/>
        The weather worsened as they drove, along with her mood.<br/><br/>
        “It’s a big company,” Johnny said. “Levitton Manufacturing...electronic parts...a chance to get ahead....”<br/><br/>
        She nodded briefly, then returned to staring out the window. He finally gave up his attempts at small talk, and they
        drove on in silence, broken only by the squeaky thumps of windshield wipers.<br/><br/>
        As they reached the outskirts of Levittown, the rain stopped and the sun shone the warm light.<br/><br/>
        “A good sign,” Johnny said, looking up at the sky.<br/><br/>
        She nodded silently.<br/><br/>
        After a few wrong turns, they found their new home, and Libby stared solemnly at the tiny box in the middle of
        identical boxes, like Monopoly houses lined up on Oriental Avenue.<br/><br/>
        “Are you ever going to smile again, Lib?”<br/><br/>
        She climbed out of the cab and scolded herself. Grow up, Libby. Do you think this is any easier for him?<br/><br/>
        She wanted to sayshe was sorry, but the ever ready tears welled up and she turned away. Without a word, they
        carried boxes into the house, setting them down wherever they could find room.<br/><br/>
        “Sit down and rest, Lib,” Johnny said. “I’ll finish unloading.” She sat on a box and stared out the window. At least
        it stopped raining.<br/><br/>
        A knock interrupted her thoughts, and she opened the door to a girl about her own age, obviously pregnant,
        holding a small plate of cookies. “Welcome to the neighborhood,” she said. “I’m Susan, but everybody calls me Souie.”<br/><br/>
        They sat on boxes, eating cookies and comparing pregnancies, morning sickness and backaches. Souie was due in
        two months. Libby in four.<br/><br/>
        “I can come over tomorrow and help you settle in if you like,” Souie said. “It’s so good to have someone to talk
        to.”<br/><br/>
        Amen, thought Libby.<br/><br/>
        After Souie left, Libby glanced around the room with a new eye. I may need some blue curtains in the
        kitchen...<br/><br/>
        The door suddenly sprang open and Johnny ran in, hurriedly digging through the boxes. He pulled out a small
        radio, plugged it into the wall socket, and suddenly “their song” and the voice of Elvis singing drifted into the kitchen.<br/><br/>
        They heard the disc jockey’s voice over the music, “...and this request comes from a pair of newcomers in town.<br/><br/>
        Congratulations to John and Libby Dalton on their wedding anniversary.”<br/><br/>
        Johnny had remembered their anniversary. She had forgotten. Tears streamed down her face, and the wall of
        silence and self-pity she had built around herself crumbled.<br/><br/>
        He pulled her up to him, and she heard his voice singing soft and sweet in her ear.<br/><br/>
        Together they danced in between the packing cartons, clinging to each other as if discovering love for the first
        time. Sunlight filtered through the window in the new house, and as she felt the first kicks of the new life inside her,
        Libby Dalton learned the meaning of love.`,

        name: `Is there really a prince charming?`,
        title: ``,
        author: `Diana Chapman`,
        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `A lot of girls grow up thinking that a Prince Charming roams the skies and the
        plains just waiting for that special moment to zoom into their lives, snatch them
        up and carry them away from a world of shrouded gloom to one of white,
        wedded bliss.<br/><br/>
        When girls flower into womanhood, they are always a bit shocked to discover they
        are Cinderella or Snow White, and the man they thought was Prince Charming really
        turned out to be Prince Clod.<br/><br/>
        Marianne had lived a life like Cinderella, sweeping parking lots for a dollar a day at
        age eight, trying to provide for herself and her baby brothers as her mother lived daily
        tackling a mental illness. When she had just passed her teen years, she met the man she
        thought was her Prince Charming.<br/><br/>
        She met him where she was a waitress, and he enthralled her. He is a musician with a
        successful band. He seemed to have the widest, most endearing eyes when he spotted her. And why not? She looked as
        sweet as Cinderella, blonde-brown curls, emerald green eyes and a face that echoed of innocence and love, which was
        really the look of an awestruck teenager.<br/><br/>
        All Marianne could think was: He loves me. He loves me. He loves me.<br/><br/>
        And this was true at the time. With the speed of a stallion, the man grabbed her up in his arms and carried her off
        to marriage. Every thing was perfect as far as Marianne was concerned. She had a nice home and enjoyed watching her
        husband play in his band. She felt loved and adored for the first time in her life. And she was about to have a baby.<br/><br/>
        She didn’t know about the other women.<br/><br/>
        The two were also ill-fated in another way. They had not only wedded each other, but they wedded their recessive
        genes. When her first son, Loren, arrived, Marianne knew something was wrong. He didn’t respond to sound. For a
        year, Marianne consulted with doctors who told her nothing was wrong.<br/><br/>
        But finally a specialist announced that Loren was deaf and that there was nothing she could do. She sobbed for the
        first two years of Loren’s life while her husband kept saying that their son was just fine.<br/><br/>
        Doctors assured them that another child wouldn’t suffer such misfortune. But when Lance was born, they soon
        learned the newborn was deaf, too.<br/><br/>
        The walls of their already strained marriage, which stood on a young girl’s fairy -tale dreams, cracked, but they
        caved in when Marianne grew angry that her husband didn’t want to learn to communicate with his two sons.<br/><br/>
        He left that to her. She learned sign language as quickly as possible. Her husband wasn’t interested. When he talked
        to the boys, he treated them like they were dogs, patting them on the head, barking out a word or two.<br/><br/>
        She took her sons to her husband’s parents’ house. His parents ignored the kids.<br/><br/>
        She took her sons shopping. Clerks gasped when her sons made grunting sounds. And now, she knew about the
        other women. Sometimes her husband didn’t bother to come home. Her friends quit calling her and Marianne felt a
        biting loneliness.<br/><br/>
        The stress and the loneliness began to destroy Marianne. She sucked down alcohol like it was water. She fed and
        clothed her sons, put them to bed, but refused to leave her home. She thought about slashing her wrists.<br/><br/>
        “Imagine, when your friends and your own family don’t bother to want to learn to communicate with your sons,”
        she explained. “You don’t have to know sign language. Kindness is a language. We all understand it. When you see a
        child like this, don’t act shocked. Don’t gasp and walk away. The message you send to a child is: ‘My God, you are a
        freak.’ Reach out your hand and smile.”<br/><br/>
        Smiles, hugs and kisses are what saved Marianne’s life. Lance and Loren’s eyes were pools of adoration and love –
        a true love. The type Marianne had never experienced in her life.<br/><br/>
        It became apparent to Marianne that she could squander her own life away with alcohol and panic attacks, but she
        couldn’t waste her sons’ lives like this. She buckled down and went back to school to earn a high school degree. She got
        a job with an insurance firm and saved her pennies.<br/><br/>
        The better she felt about herself, the prouder she grew of Loren and Lance. She started bringing them to visit with
        her coworkers, who showered them with kindness. It was time for her and her boys to leave their house, cut ties with
        the father and move on with their lives.<br/><br/>
        One day, her sons came with her to work, and when she walked into the office of the insurance manager, a man
        named Eric, she found Loren sitting on his lap. Eric looked up at her. He said these simple words: “I feel like an idiot.
        I’d love to talk with your son. Do you know where I could go learn sign language?”<br/><br/>
        Marianne thought she would faint. Not a soul had ever asked her before if they could learn to communicate with
        her sons. She was shaking inside as she explained to Eric that if he was really interested, she knew where he could
        learn. Eric showed quickly he wasn’t kidding when he enrolled in the class and began to sign words of hello to her in a
        few days.<br/><br/>
        When the kids came in, he took them for walks along the pier near their office. Often she went along and watched
        Eric, who was becoming a master of sign language, talk and laugh with her boys as no one else had before.<br/><br/>
        And each time her sons saw Eric they brightened like the sun and stars in the sky. She had never seen them so
        happy. Her heart twitched as though it were being strummed. She began to fall in love.<br/><br/>
        She didn’t know if Eric felt the same until they left work together one evening and took a stroll out on a pier above
        the Pacific Ocean. He signed to her that he was in love and wanted to marry. Marianne’s heart danced with joy.<br/><br/>
        The couple moved into a small town and opened up a thriving insurance business. They had two more children,
        Casey and Katie, neither of whom were born deaf, but both learned sign language before the age of five.<br/><br/>
        And at the happiest moments of her life, Marianne would wake up in the middle of the night, her ear burning in
        pain, and begin to sob. Her behavior was inexplicable because she couldn’t think of a time when she felt more loved or
        happy.<br/><br/>
        Eric would run his hands across her hair, hold her chin and ask her what was wrong. All she could say was: “I don’t
        know. I don’t know.” He held her for a long while. Weeks went by and Marianne continued to wake up sobbing.<br/><br/>
        Then, like a lightning bolt, she woke up knowing the answer.<br/><br/>
        She cried to Eric that she wasn’t doing enough to help deaf children in the world. She was supposed to help them
        find their place in society. She was supposed to teach the world how to communicate with these children.<br/><br/>
        Eric wrapped his arms around her and said: “Let’s do it.”<br/><br/>
        Together they formed Hands Across America - “It Starts with You” - an organization that encourages the public to
        learn sign language and has started making educational videos that use both deaf and hearing children together.<br/><br/>
        So if you ever have a chance to talk with Marianne and ask her if there is any truth to fairy tales like Cinderella and
        Snow White, she’ll probably sayshe’s learned a lot about such stories in her lifetime.<br/><br/>
        She’s likely to say : “There sure are a lot of Prince Clods out there. But there sure are some Prince Charmings, and
        there are really a lot of Cinderellas, too.”

        title: `The great doing of little things makes the great life`,
        author: `David A. Manzi`,
        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `She is my wife, my lover, my best friend. For over fourteen years, our
        marriage has endured and grown. I can honestly state that after all
        this time together, my love for Patricia has not diminished in the
        slightest way. In fact, through each passing day, I find myself more
        and more enraptured by her beauty. The best times of my life are the
        times we spend together, whether sitting quietly watching television or
        enjoying an afternoon at a San Diego Chargers game.<br/><br/>
        There is no secret to why our marriage has lasted while so many
        others have failed. There is no formula for success that I can offer, other
        than to express that the most important feature of our relationship is that
        it has never lost the sense of romance that bloomed when we first met. Too
        often marriage kills the romance that was born in the courtship of a
        relationship. To me, I have always felt that I am still courting Patricia, and
        therefore the romance has never died.<br/><br/>
        Romance is not something that can be taught or copied. One can only be romantic through another. Patricia, my
        wife of fourteen years, has instilled the romance in me. I am romantic because of her. Patricia has always brought out
        the best in me. The many aspects of our romance are too numerous to mention. However, there is one special
        romantic interlude that I began over fifteen years ago.<br/><br/>
        Before we were married, Patricia and I could not see each other as much as we would have liked during the week.<br/><br/>
        The weekends always went too fast, and the days in between dragged on forever. I decided that I needed to do
        something to make the weekdays go faster, or at least to give us something to look forward to during the week.<br/><br/>
        And so it began one Wednesdaysome fifteen years ago: I bought a card and gave it to Patricia. There was no
        special occasion. The card was just an expression of how much I loved her and how much I was thinking about her. I
        picked Wednesday for no special reason other than it was the middle of the week.<br/><br/>
        Since that day, I have never missed a Wednesday - Patricia has received a card from me every Wednesday, every
        week, every month, every year.<br/><br/>
        The purchase of the card each week is not done out of habit. It is my romantic mission each week to find the right
        card. At times, my search takes me to many different card stores to find that perfect offering. I have been known to
        spend a considerable amount of time in front of the card display s, reading up to a dozen different cards before I choose
        the right one. The picture and the words in the card must have specific meaning to me and must remind me in some
        way of Patricia and our life together. The card needs to evoke an emotion in me. I know that if a card brings a tear of
        happiness to my eyes, I have found the right one.<br/><br/>
        Patricia awakens each Wednesday morning to find her card, and even though she knows it will be there, she still
        lights up with excitement when she tears open the envelope and reads what is inside. And I still get just as excited
        giving each card to her.<br/><br/>
        At the foot of our bed is a brass chest that is filled with all of the greeting cards Patricia has received from me over
        the past fifteen years, hundreds and hundreds of cards, each one full of just as much love as the next. I can only hope
        that our life together will last long enough for me to fill ten brass chests with my weekly messages of love, affection and
        most of all thanks for the joy Patricia has brought to my life.

        title: `Memory is the gift from God which death cannot destroy`,
        author: `Cindy Landon with Kathryn Casey`,
        content: `ca`,
        contentEn: `learned a lot from Michael Landon. Today I believe that my strength comes from
        him. Weeks before he died, he wrote his parting advice to me. It’s very special to me
        and I read it often. In it he said, “Be strong. Be solid. Live life, love it and be happy.”<br/><br/>
        Michael once told me, “Don’t grieve too long.” I’m trying, but losing someone like
        Michael is something that stays with you forever.<br/><br/>
        When you lose someone you love, you struggle with it everyday. At first, our
        fiveyear- old, Sean, had a tough time talking about his father. Just recently he began
        watching Michael on television again and admitting how much he misses him. Still, this
        morning he told me he missed his daddy so much his stomach hurt. Jennifer is eight and
        it’s been rough for her, too. All three of us are in therapy. We just take life day by day.<br/><br/>
        The children and I visit the cemetery often. We bring Michael letters, usually just to
        tell him about what we’re feeling and what is happening in our lives. But I really don’t feel
        as close to him there as I do at home, where there are pictures of him in every room and
        his clothes are still in his closet, just as he left them. This is where Michael most loved to
        be. Sometimes, especially when I go up to bed at night, I wish he was waiting upstairs and we could just sit down and
        discuss the day’s events.<br/><br/>
        I first met Michael when I was nineteen and hired as a stand-in on Little House on the Prairie. Seeing the way he
        treated everybody, I developed a terrible crush. One night, two years after I’d joined the show, he came to my
        apartment after a party on the set. From that moment on, we were wildly in love.<br/><br/>
        Michael and I were married on Valentine’s Day, 1983. As a husband, he was the best - strong, caring, supportive
        and very witty. Michael was also a homebody. Everyday before he left the studio, he’d call and ask what we needed
        from the market. He’d show up with a bag of goodies in his arms. Michael loved to cook, and on many nights he’d take
        over the kitchen. His specialties were Italian dishes like spaghetti with sausage and chicken cacciatore.<br/><br/>
        He was as good a father as he was a husband. I used to love to watch him with the children, especially on
        vacations. In Hawaii, he taught them to skip stones across the water and got as excited as the children did when they
        dis-covered a beautiful shell or a tiny hermit crab. He would spend hours, literally hours, playing in the ocean with
        Sean and Jennifer. Every thing was just perfect. Michael loved our life and his work. He’d always been incredibly
        healthy. We were looking forward to growing old together.<br/><br/>
        Then in February 1991, he began having abdominal pains. It was always tough to get Michael to see a doctor.<br/><br/>
        Finally I made an appointment, and he was examined for an ulcer. Nothing was found, but they put him on some
        medicine that helped for a while.<br/><br/>
        In early April, the pain resurfaced. Four days later - April 5 - we had the results of the biopsy : pancreatic cancer
        that had metastasized to the liver.<br/><br/>
        Looking back, I now believe Michael knew even then that he wasn’t going to make it. Pancreatic cancer is swift and
        lethal, with a five-year survival rate of only 3 percent. I was angry, stunned. Why was this happening? Michael looked
        at it more pragmatically, as he did every thing in his life. From the moment he was diagnosed until the day he died, he
        was never angry. Once he told me, “It’s not God who does it. It’s the disease. God doesn’t give you cancer.” For
        Michael, death wasn’t something to fear, but he didn’t want to die. He didn’t want to leave everyone he loved.<br/><br/>
        We leveled with the kids from the beginning. Michael and I called our older children to tell them what was going
        on, and then we sat down with our two little ones. We told them that Daddy had a very serious type of cancer and that
        Daddy was going to do the best he could to fight it, but there were no guarantees. Sean was very calm. I’m not sure he
        really understood. Jennifer, too, seemed to take it well, but later there were indications she was suffering inside -
        stomachaches, headaches and anxiety attacks.<br/><br/>
        These first moments were before the storm, the hurricane of media that surrounded us as soon as news of
        Michael’s disease hit the press. Photographers staked out our home and the hospital. They climbed over our walls and
        peeked in our windows. The tabloids came out with bizarre stories. Almost every week, they printed a new fabrication.<br/><br/>
        Once they said Michael had only four weeks to live. Another time, they claimed the cancer had spread to his colon.<br/><br/>
        Neither was true. At the same time, the public responded with compassion and love. We received a flood of letters -
        twelve thousand a week. Michael was deeply moved, and he told me, “This is the first time I’ve realized how many lives
        I’ve touched.”<br/><br/>
        In less than a month, the cancer doubled in size. For the first time, I think both of us realized Michael was
        probably going to die. That afternoon, we held each other. I lay my head on his lap and cried. Michael stroked my hair
        and whispered, “I know, I know.”<br/><br/>
        Although he had resisted at first, Michael finally agreed to undergo experimental chemotherapy. He hated the
        idea, and I don’t think he would have done it if it wasn’t for the children and me. He was making a final effort to survive.<br/><br/>
        Michael’s health continued to deteriorate, however, and by Father’s Day, June 16, it was obvious to all of us that
        we wouldn’t have him with us much longer. In past years, we bought Michael gifts like tennis rackets. This year there
        were pajamas and beautiful homemade cards. The whole family showed up to see him.<br/><br/>
        Shortly after Father’s Day, Michael told me that he only had a week to live. That last week, Michael’s health
        continued to fail. Then, on Sunday morning, June 30, the nurse told me they believed the end was near, so I called the
        children and Michael’s best friends to the house. Since the doctors had increased his morphine and Percocet, Michael
        was drowsy and drifted in and out of consciousness. Throughout the last day, each of us said our private good-byes
        and let Michael know that it was okay. If he was ready to die, it was all right to let go.<br/><br/>
        The next morning, Michael was in a dreamlike state, and we were all in the bedroom again when he suddenly sat
        up in bed and said, “Hi. I love you guys.” Then a little while later, Michael asked the others to leave so we could be
        alone. Looking back, I believe he was ready to die, and he really didn’t want it to happen in front of the whole family.<br/><br/>
        I stayed with Michael, waiting for the inevitable. Sometimes he drifted off into almost a trance. At one point I
        asked him, “Do you know who I am?” He looked at me and answered, “Y eah.” I said, “I love you.” He answered, “I love
        you, too.” Those were his last words. A moment later, he stopped breathing.<br/><br/>
        I felt stunned and stayed with Michael for a little while before I went downstairs to tell the others that he had died.<br/><br/>
        There was, however, little time for contemplation. As if they somehow knew, we heard the swirl of helicopters
        overhead as the press circled in. Suddenly we heard screaming outside. Jennifer had climbed to the top of the swing
        set and was shouting, “Not my daddy. Not my daddy. I don’t want my daddy to die.” I told the others to let her be,
        because I wanted her to be able to get it out. Soon she climbed down and was sobbing in my arms.<br/><br/>
        A while later, the undertaker arrived. When they carried Michael’s body out, I knew he was never coming back.<br/><br/>
        That was the finality of it - Michael was gone.<br/><br/>
        That night, both children slept with me. Jennifer and I wore two of Michael’s shirts to bed with us. I felt like I
        didn’t belong anywhere, like I just didn’t fit in anymore.<br/><br/>
        I was completely lost, lonely.<br/><br/>
        The best thing I could do was leave, so I took the kids away for four weeks in Hawaii. We went to a place Michael
        and I loved. It was hard, because he wasn’t there. But it was even tougher coming home, knowing that Michael
        wouldn’t be waiting for us.<br/><br/>
        We’re getting better, but it all takes time. The children still sleep with me sometimes, though not as often as in the
        beginning. They just seem to need to be hugged more often. And I continue to have some very difficult moments. A
        few days ago, I was on the expressway and got off at the wrong exit. I ended up at the studio. That was where the
        children and I would go visit Daddy. It was such a part of our lives. But Michael is gone, and all of our lives are
        changing.<br/><br/>
        It’s odd, but before Michael died, I was frightened of death. I used to worry about illness or sometimes just getting
        on an airplane. Now I’m no longer afraid. Life is too short. You never know, so you’d better make the best of every
        moment.<br/><br/>
        When I think about Michael, what I remember most is how he relished life and how fiercely he loved his family.<br/><br/>
        Ours was a good marriage: Michael was always there for me, and I was always there for him. He told me once, after he’d
        been diagnosed, that win or lose he could handle whatever happened. He said, “I’ve had an incredible life, great
        happiness.” I miss Michael everyday, but I know wherever he is, he’s happy and well - and that someday I’ll see him
        again.`,
